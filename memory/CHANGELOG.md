- ✅ Custom dark slate + orange (positive) / cyan (negative) OrcaSlicer-inspired theme

## Iteration 2 (2026-05-15) — Profiles + P2 Polish
- ✅ **Printer profiles** for Bambu Lab (P1S, A1, A1 mini, X1C), Prusa (MK4, MINI, XL), Creality (Ender-3, Pro, V3 SE, K1), FlashForge (Adventurer 5M, Creator Pro 2, Finder), Anycubic (Kobra 2), Sovol (SV06, SV07, SV08), Voron 2.4, plus Custom. Build volume drives the visible build plate. Hotend/bed max temperatures power compatibility warnings.
- ✅ **Filament profiles** (PLA, PLA+, PETG, ABS, ASA, TPU, Nylon, PC) with recommended hotend/bed temps, retraction, and speed multipliers — automatically applied when selecting filament.
- ✅ **Compatibility warning panel** flags out-of-build-volume models, hotend/bed over printer max, and hotend out of filament range.
- ✅ **(c) Real dimension editing for imported STL** — bbox X/Y/Z mm shown in Inspector for imported meshes; editing rescales the geometry to the requested mm.
- ✅ **(e) Undo / Redo** — Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Y (or Ctrl+Shift+Z), toolbar buttons, 60-step history stack. Snapshots taken before every meaningful action and at gizmo drag start.
- ✅ **(a) Measurement tool** — toolbar toggle or `M` shortcut; click two points on any object → persistent green dimension line + mm label. Multi-measurement support. Clear-all button in Scene stats.
- ✅ **(b) Live bbox dimensions overlay** — hovering above the currently-selected object's bounding box, in real mm, updates live during gizmo drag.
- ✅ Status bar surfaces printer, build, filament, mode (incl. MEASURE), and history depth.

## Patches / Quirks
- `@emergentbase/visual-edits` injects `x-line-number` etc. into all JSX, which broke react-three-fiber's `applyProps`. Three R3F bundles in `/app/frontend/node_modules/@react-three/fiber/dist/` were patched to skip props starting with `x-`, `data-ve-`, `data-debug-`. If `node_modules` is reinstalled the patches must be re-applied.

## Testing Summary
- Backend pytest: 8/8 passing for gallery CRUD.
- Frontend: workspace, primitives, outliner, inspector, transforms, boolean union, share/orca dialogs, slice→GCODE download all verified.

## Iteration 3 (2026-05-15) — Polish + Community Profiles
- ✅ **Drop to Bed** on rotate: rotating an object via numeric input or gizmo automatically snaps it so the lowest point sits on Y=0 (matches TinkerCAD). Toggleable in the Printer & Filament panel; manual "Drop to Bed" button in Inspector.
- ✅ **Friendlier measurement labels**: fixed-size, larger text-sm labels with green outline + individual X-close button per measurement; endpoints now `1.2mm` spheres with `depthTest=false` so they stay visible behind geometry.
- ✅ **Auto-hide measurements** when the measure tool is turned off (re-appear when toggled on again).
- ✅ **Auto-purge** of any measurement whose referenced object is deleted (object ID stored per endpoint).
- ✅ **Community Printer Profiles**: full backend (`POST/GET/DELETE /api/printers`, `POST /api/printers/{id}/use` for popularity), plus a "Save mine" dialog with form. Community submissions show under a "Community" optgroup in the printer dropdown, with submitter name, notes, and a × removal button for moderation.

## Iteration 4 (2026-05-15) — Manifold-Warning + Dynamic Send-to-Slicer
- ✅ **Improved CSG output**: bumped default segment counts (cylinder/cone 64, sphere/torus 48) and added a custom vertex-welding cleanup at 5-micron tolerance after every Boolean operation. Still drops zero-area triangles. This significantly reduces (but cannot always eliminate) the non-manifold edges three-bvh-csg leaves on near-tangent boolean boundaries.
- ✅ **Manifold health chip** in the right panel: detects open boundary edges after CSG and shows a blue, reassuring chip — "Your print will still slice fine — modern slicers (OrcaSlicer, PrusaSlicer, FlashPrint 5, Bambu Studio) all auto-repair on import." Hidden when geometry is watertight or scene is empty.
- ✅ **Dynamic Send-to-Slicer split button**: button label, dialog title, install link, and how-to-open instructions all adapt to the printer's recommended primary slicer. A chevron dropdown surfaces alternates when more than one slicer is recommended for the printer:
  - Bambu Lab → Bambu Studio (alt: OrcaSlicer)
  - Prusa → PrusaSlicer (alt: OrcaSlicer, SuperSlicer)
  - Creality → Creality Print (alt: OrcaSlicer, Cura)
  - FlashForge (Adv 5M, AD5X, Creator 5/5 Pro) → FlashPrint 5 (alt: OrcaSlicer FF fork, OrcaSlicer)
  - FlashForge Finder → FlashPrint 5 (single — no dropdown)
  - Elegoo → Elegoo Slicer (alt: Cura, OrcaSlicer)
  - Sovol → OrcaSlicer (alt: PrusaSlicer, SuperSlicer)
  - Voron → SuperSlicer (alt: OrcaSlicer, PrusaSlicer)
  - Custom → OrcaSlicer (alt: PrusaSlicer, Cura)

## Iteration 5 (2026-05-15) — Worker Offload, Landing Import, Multi-Color 3MF
- ✅ **Landing-page Import** (`hero-cta-import`): users can drop in an existing STL, 3MF, or OBJ from the landing page and skip straight into the workspace with the mesh loaded. New `lib/pendingImport.js` is StrictMode-safe (idempotent consume). Workspace shows a transient success/error banner (`import-banner`).
- ✅ **3MF Import**: parses `3D/3dmodel.model` XML out of the 3MF zip, merges all `<object>` meshes, recenters to build-plate origin (`importAnyMeshFile` dispatch).
- ✅ **Web Worker offload** (`lib/workers/csg.worker.js` + `lib/workerClient.js`): all heavy operations now run off the main thread — `evaluateSceneStatsAsync` (manifold check), `combineTwoAsync` (booleans), `sliceToGCODEAsync` (slicer), `exportSTLBytesAsync`, `export3MFBytesAsync`. Falls back to main-thread if Worker construction fails. Non-clonable Zustand actions are stripped from slice settings before crossing the worker boundary.
- ✅ **Multi-color 3MF export**: each object now carries a `colorIndex` (0..7) and the Inspector exposes 8 color swatches. The Viewport renders each object in its assigned palette color. When 2+ distinct colors are in the scene, `export-3mf-btn` automatically emits a multi-object 3MF with `<basematerials>` + `forgeslicer:colorIndex` metadata so downstream slicers (Bambu Studio, OrcaSlicer) can map parts to AMS slots.
- ✅ **Backend pytest** extended 14 → 20 (added remix-lineage + upvote/sort suites).

## Iteration 6 (2026-05-15) — Top-toolbar Popovers + Aspect Lock + 3MF Namespace Fix
- ✅ **Top-bar quick-access popovers** (`menu-position-btn`, `menu-rotation-btn`, `menu-scale-btn`, `menu-slicer-btn`) replace the scroll-heavy right panel. Position/Rotation/Scale buttons disable when nothing is selected; clicking opens an anchored popover (Esc / outside-click to dismiss).
- ✅ **Scale popover with side-by-side Percent + Real Size columns** and a `scale-lock-toggle` aspect-ratio checkbox (default ON). When locked, editing any axis (in either column) rescales the other two by the same ratio. Unlocked = free per-axis scaling. Bases for sizing come from a new `getBaseSize(obj)` helper that handles all primitive types + imported meshes.
- ✅ Right-panel Inspector simplified: now Name, Pos/Neg toggle, Drop-to-Bed, Color picker, a read-only Pos/Rot/Scale summary chip ("use top toolbar"), and primitive Dimensions only.
- ✅ **3MF import — namespace fix**: switched `getElementsByTagName` → `getElementsByTagNameNS("*", "vertex"/"triangle"/"object")` so producers that use the namespace prefix (`<m:vertex>`, common in Bambu/Orca-derived 3MF files) parse correctly. Verified with a prefixed-3MF round-trip.
- ✅ **3MF import — multi-part fallback**: if `3D/3dmodel.model` has zero vertices (Bambu Studio splits meshes across `Metadata/model_*.model`), the importer now walks every `*.model` in the zip.
- ✅ **Landing-page Import** (`hero-cta-import`): users can drop in an existing STL, 3MF, or OBJ from the landing page and skip straight into the workspace with the mesh loaded. New `lib/pendingImport.js` is StrictMode-safe (idempotent consume). Workspace shows a transient success/error banner (`import-banner`).
- ✅ **3MF Import**: parses `3D/3dmodel.model` XML out of the 3MF zip, merges all `<object>` meshes, recenters to build-plate origin (`importAnyMeshFile` dispatch).
- ✅ **Web Worker offload** (`lib/workers/csg.worker.js` + `lib/workerClient.js`): all heavy operations now run off the main thread — `evaluateSceneStatsAsync` (manifold check), `combineTwoAsync` (booleans), `sliceToGCODEAsync` (slicer), `exportSTLBytesAsync`, `export3MFBytesAsync`. Falls back to main-thread if Worker construction fails. Non-clonable Zustand actions are stripped from slice settings before crossing the worker boundary.
- ✅ **Multi-color 3MF export**: each object now carries a `colorIndex` (0..7) and the Inspector exposes 8 color swatches (`color-swatch-0` .. `color-swatch-7`). The Viewport renders each object in its assigned palette color. When 2+ distinct colors are in the scene, `export-3mf-btn` automatically emits a multi-object 3MF with a `<basematerials>` block and `forgeslicer:colorIndex` metadata so downstream slicers (Bambu Studio, OrcaSlicer) can map parts to AMS slots.
- ✅ **Backend pytest** (`backend/tests/`) extended from 14 → 20: added `TestRemixLineage` (3) and `test_upvote_increments`, `test_upvote_404`, `test_list_sort_order_top_voted_first` (3). All green.

## Iteration 8 (2026-02-17) — Grouping, Marquee Box-Select, Keyboard Shortcuts
- ✅ **Grouping / Assemble** — multi-selected components can be grouped together so they move and duplicate as a single unit. `store.groupSelected(name)` stamps each member with a shared `groupId` + `groupName`; `selectObject(id)` is group-aware and expands selection to all siblings when clicking a member. `ungroupSelected()` drops the markers.
- ✅ **Right-click Context Menu** (`components/ContextMenu.jsx`) — opens on right-click in the viewport OR outliner, with Group, Ungroup, Flatten, Duplicate, Mirror X/Y/Z, and Delete. Menu snapshots selection at mount (`useState` initializer) so transient external clears can't disable items.
- ✅ **Flatten to Single Mesh** — atomic CSG bake of the selected subset into one imported mesh (originals removed, baked mesh inserted, single `setState`).
- ✅ **Marquee Box Selection** — hold **Shift** to reveal an overlay; drag a rectangle anywhere on the viewport to select every mesh whose projected bbox intersects the rect. **Ctrl+Shift+drag** adds to existing selection. OrbitControls auto-disabled during the drag.
- ✅ **Keyboard Shortcuts** added in `TopToolbar.jsx`: `Delete`/`Backspace` → remove all selected (ignored in inputs); `Ctrl/Cmd+D` → duplicate selection; `Esc` → clear selection (when measure mode is off); existing G/R/S/M/Ctrl+Z/Ctrl+Y preserved.
- ✅ **Outliner** renders grouped members nested under a collapsible "ASSEMBLY" header (`group-<id>`, `group-toggle-<id>`).
- ✅ **Bug fixes during this iteration**:
  - Viewport `onPointerMissed` no longer clears selection on right-click pointer-up (was wiping selection before the context-menu's action ran).
  - `doFlatten` collapsed to a single atomic `setState` (originals filtered + baked mesh inserted in the same update) — previously two sequential `set()`s raced and left orphans.
- ✅ Verified by `testing_agent_v3_fork` iteration_5.json — all 13 review cases pass (10 fully, 3 partial due to test selector mismatch only).

## Iteration 9 (2026-02-19) — Phase 2: User Authentication
- ✅ **Emergent-managed Google OAuth** — frontend `lib/auth.js` redirects to `https://auth.emergentagent.com/?redirect=…`; AuthCallback (`components/AuthCallback.jsx`) consumes the `#session_id=` fragment synchronously and exchanges it via backend `POST /api/auth/session` for a 7-day httpOnly cookie.
- ✅ **Backend auth core** (`server.py`): `users` + `user_sessions` collections, `get_current_user` / `get_optional_user` dependencies (cookie OR Bearer), `POST /api/auth/session`, `GET /api/auth/me`, `POST /api/auth/logout`. CORS already allows `credentials=True`.
- ✅ **Private libraries** — `gallery` & `components` records carry `user_id` + `private` flags. Public list endpoints filter out private items. New `GET /api/me/designs` and `GET /api/me/components` return the current user's full library (public + private). Owner-only DELETE enforced (anonymous still works for legacy items without `user_id`).
- ✅ **Author attribution** — when logged-in users POST to `/api/gallery` or `/api/components`, the server overrides any client-supplied `author` with the profile name; anonymous users keep the free-text field.
- ✅ **Legacy migration on startup** — idempotent renaming of pre-auth gallery+components: any doc missing `user_id` gets `author = "Legacy · <original_author>"` + `private:false`, with original kept under `_legacy_author` for forensics.
- ✅ **Frontend AuthProvider** (`contexts/AuthContext.jsx`) — race-safe: skips `/auth/me` when URL hash contains `session_id=` so AuthCallback consumes the one-shot token first. axios `withCredentials:true` set globally AND per-call.
- ✅ **UI surfaces**: 
  - `UserMenu.jsx` in Landing, Workspace, Gallery headers. Anonymous → `login-btn` (Sign in). Authenticated → avatar dropdown with Profile / My Designs / My Components / Sign out.
  - `Profile.jsx` at `/profile` — banner with picture/name/email + 4 StatTiles (Designs, Components, Total Remixes, Component Upvotes) + tabbed (`?tab=designs|components`) personal grids. Anonymous visit renders a sign-in gate.
  - `ShareDialog` and `SaveComponentDialog` (`Dialogs.jsx`) gained auth-aware Author render: signed-in users see a readonly badge + a `share-private-toggle` / `component-private-toggle`; anonymous users keep the free-text input plus a `share-signin-cta` / `component-signin-cta` nudge.
- ✅ **Tests** — 9 new auth pytest cases (`tests/test_auth_api.py`) + 7 reused private-library cases passed by testing agent. Frontend testing agent (iteration_10) confirmed both anonymous and authenticated variants of both dialogs.

## Iteration 15 (2026-02-19) — Whisper STT Integration · Color Picker Fix
- ✅ **Color picker bug fixed** — `Viewport.colorForObject` no longer special-cases `colorIndex === 0` to return ForgeSlicer orange; the renderer now maps 1:1 with the picker palette. Default `colorIndex` for new positive primitives bumped from 0 → 7 (Orange) so existing UX is preserved; picking the "White" swatch now correctly renders white.
- ✅ **Whisper STT (OpenAI whisper-1) integrated** as the primary voice-command transcription path, replacing the browser's Web Speech API which had poor accent handling:
  - **Backend**: new `POST /api/voice/transcribe` accepts multipart audio (webm/opus, mp4, wav, ogg), forwards to `OpenAISpeechToText(api_key=EMERGENT_LLM_KEY).transcribe(...)` with `model="whisper-1"`, `language="en"`, `temperature=0`, and a CAD-vocabulary `prompt` hint that biases recognition toward "cube/cylinder/union/subtract/millimetre/…" terms for measurably better accuracy on rare CAD words.
  - **Frontend**: new `/app/frontend/src/lib/whisperStt.js` records audio with `MediaRecorder` (auto-picks supported MIME from webm/opus → mp4 → ogg), POSTs blob to the backend, returns transcript. Hard cap of 25 MB. Graceful `NotAllowedError` handling for denied microphone access.
  - **VoiceButton rewrite**: state machine `idle → recording → transcribing → confirm → parsing → feedback`. The confirm step shows the Whisper transcript in an editable input with **Run** / **Cancel** / **Retry** so users can fix any residual misrecognitions before GPT-5.2 parses it into a command.
- ✅ **Smoke tests**: 80/80 backend pytest still passing; `POST /api/voice/transcribe` validated end-to-end with a synthesized WAV file (Whisper returned a transcript, confirming the Emergent LLM key + endpoint wiring are healthy).
- ✅ **#3 Ctrl-Z destroying model after CSG ops** — root cause: `doBool` in TopToolbar called `removeObject` twice + `addRawObject` once, each pushing a separate history entry, so the latest snapshot captured the empty-scene state after removals but before insert. Added new atomic `replaceObjects(idsToRemove, newObjects)` action on the store that mutates objects in a single `set()` and pushes history exactly once. `doBool` now uses this. Confirmed via testing agent: cube + sphere → Union → 1 merged → Ctrl-Z → 2 separate objects (not zero).
- ✅ **#7.1 Z-axis flip in place** — when source position was 0 on the mirror axis, `-0 == 0` and the copy stacked on the original. Fixed by `duplicateSelected` computing the source's rotated bounding-box extent on that axis and placing the copy at `source + extent + offset` so it's always adjacent and visibly mirrored.
- ✅ **#1.3 Outliner rename** — new `setObjectName(id, name)` store action; OutlinerRow now supports double-click to enter inline rename, Enter to commit, Escape to cancel.
- ✅ **#7.1 sidenote Right-click menu clipping** — ContextMenu measures itself with `getBoundingClientRect` post-mount and re-clamps so it never overflows the viewport bottom-right. Added `max-h-[85vh] overflow-y-auto` as a fallback for very tall menus.
- ✅ **#1.2 Polygon sides** — Inspector now exposes a `Sides` NumberField for cylinder/cone primitives (3=triangle, 4=square, 6=hex, 8=octagon, 32+=smooth circle) and `Segments` for spheres.
- ✅ **#2.2 15° snap precision** — `Viewport.handleChange` rounds `radToDeg` outputs to 1e-4 precision, eliminating the `14.999999999998°` floating-point noise after gizmo snap.
- ✅ **#1.3.36 dimension order** — Inspector cube dim labels changed from `W / D / H` to `X / Y / Z` (matches storage keys + user's mental model: x=length, y=width, z=height). Viewport bbox label now renders `X × Y × Z` order instead of `X × Z × Y`. Added a tiny "X · Y · Z" hint to the Inspector header with a tooltip.
- ✅ **#10 Toys category** — added to both backend `COMPONENT_CATEGORIES` set, SaveComponentDialog selector, and Gallery components filter dropdown.
- ✅ **#10 Material field** — new `material:str = 'pla'` on gallery records; full materials catalog at `/app/frontend/src/lib/materials.js` (PLA, PETG, ABS, ASA, TPU, Nylon, PC, Carbon-fibre, Wood-filled, Resin, Any). ShareDialog has a Material selector; Gallery cards display a Material badge alongside the License badge; DesignsTab has a new Material filter dropdown that hits `GET /api/gallery?material=<id>`.
- ✅ **ShareDialog crash hotfix** (caught by testing agent mid-iteration): three missing definitions (`Layers` import, `materialId` useState, `MATERIALS` import) — fixed in a 3-line patch before the dialog could ship.
- ✅ **Tests** — 80/80 backend pytest pass (10 new in `tests/test_material_toys_api.py`); 8/8 P1 frontend scenarios + 4/4 regression scenarios.
- ✅ **Auth ergonomics**: `lib/auth.js` now persists the `returnPath` (the page the user was on when they clicked Sign in) in `sessionStorage` so AuthCallback can route them back to where they started — not always `/workspace`. Added an explicit 20 s timeout on the `/api/auth/session` exchange and `console.info` breadcrumbs at each stage for diagnostics.
- ✅ **AuthCallback rewrite**: 3-stage progress text (parsing → exchanging → success), expanded error UI with both "Home" and "Try again" buttons, full error string surfaced (no more silent failure).
- ✅ **App.js hash detection**: now reads `window.location.hash` directly in addition to React Router's `useLocation().hash` — some routing configs strip the fragment on first mount.
- ✅ **ProtectedRoute** (`components/ProtectedRoute.jsx`): branded sign-in card with explanation copy + Sign-in-with-Google CTA + "browse the public gallery first" link. Wraps `/workspace` and `/profile`. Skips itself if the URL hash is an OAuth callback (belt-and-braces against routing race).
- ✅ **Public routes preserved**: `/` (Landing) and `/gallery` remain anonymously accessible — anonymous users can still browse the library for ideas before signing up.
- ✅ **Gallery / Components network resilience**: `lib/api.js` introduces `fetchHeavyList()` — 45 s timeout, 2 retries on network errors and 5xx, immediate bubble on 4xx. New `apiErrorMessage(err)` helper humanises axios errors. Gallery + Components tabs render a proper error card with a Retry button (testids `gallery-retry-btn` / `components-retry-btn`) instead of bare red text.
- ✅ **Landing banner rewrite** — H1 now reads "Model. Carve. **Slice (sort of...).** Print." with a hover tooltip on "Slice (sort of...)" explaining ForgeSlicer's GCODE output is an outer-shell preview, not a production slicer. Body subtitle replaced with the user's new copy starting "CAD for people who wish they could do CAD, but don't know how...".
- ✅ **Open-source license system** — new `/app/frontend/src/lib/licenses.js` catalog (12 entries: CC-BY 4.0 default, CC-BY-SA, CC-BY-NC, CC-BY-NC-SA, CC-BY-ND, CC0, GPL v3, LGPL v3, **AGPL v3**, MIT, Apache 2.0, ForgeSlicer Standard Digital). Backend `gallery` + `components` collections gained a `license:str = "cc-by-4.0"` field; Pydantic default applies to legacy docs at response construction. ShareDialog & SaveComponentDialog gained a license `<select>` with the catalog, plain-English summary line, and a "full text →" link to the canonical license. Gallery + Components cards render a `LicenseBadge` chip (clickable when canonical URL exists), tinted by license category (emerald=permissive copyleft, cyan=public-domain-style, amber=non-commercial, slate=ForgeSlicer Standard).
- ✅ **Contributor Lifetime Tier** added to `/app/memory/PRICING_RESEARCH.md`: $0, earned by publishing **100+** non-duplicated open-licensed components AND **20+** non-duplicated open-licensed designs of original work. Standard Digital / CC-BY-NC* / CC-BY-ND don't count. Enforcement mechanics documented for Phase 3 implementation (cron recount, `users.contributor_lifetime` flag, never-demotes policy, visible counter on Profile).
- ✅ **Tests** — testing agent ran 71/71 prior backend pytest + 6 new license round-trip tests + 18 targeted frontend scenarios. All PASS. New file: `/app/backend/tests/test_license_api.py`.

## Iteration 11 (2026-02-19) — P1 Composite Slot · Library Polish · P2 Dialog Refactor
- ✅ **Slot / Racetrack composite primitive** — `store.addSlot(modifier, overrides)` builds an auto-grouped trio (1 cube core + 2 cylinder caps) sharing a fresh `groupId` + `groupName`. Defaults: width=6 mm, length=10 mm, depth=6.5 mm. New `COMPOSITES` section in `LeftPanel.jsx` exposes `add-slot-negative-btn` (default — for rack-screw holes) and `add-slot-positive-btn` (pill/key shape).
- ✅ **Expanded categories (13)** — backend `COMPONENT_CATEGORIES` widened to: mechanical, rack, mounting, **fasteners, electronics, brackets, hinges, gears, decorative, organizers, miniatures, structural**, misc. Both Gallery filter dropdown and SaveComponentDialog selector list all 13 (Gallery adds "All categories" for a total of 14 options).
- ✅ **Verified badge** — new `verified:bool` field on components; list endpoint sorts `(verified desc, votes desc, created_at desc)`; admin-only `POST /api/components/{cid}/verify` toggle is gated by `ADMIN_EMAILS` env var (returns 403 when unset for safety). Frontend renders a green `BadgeCheck` "verified" chip only when `item.verified === true`.
- ✅ **Clickable tag pills** — component tag string (`"screw, M3, 10mm"`) is split into chips on each card; clicking a pill populates the search input and re-queries `/api/components?q=…` in one tap.
- ✅ **P2 — Dialogs.jsx refactor** — original 786-line file split into focused files in `components/dialogs/`: `ShareDialog.jsx`, `OrcaDialog.jsx`, `SavePrinterDialog.jsx`, `SaveComponentDialog.jsx`. `Dialogs.jsx` is now a 7-line barrel re-export so all existing imports keep working with zero call-site changes.
- ✅ **Pricing research** — `/app/memory/PRICING_RESEARCH.md` consolidates direct competitor pricing (Tinkercad/Onshape/Fusion 360/SelfCAD), 3D-model marketplace data (Thangs/Printables/MakerWorld), 2025 indie-SaaS conversion benchmarks, a cost-coverage floor (Stripe fees + hosting), and a recommended 3-tier draft ($0 / $3 / $7) to discuss before Phase 3.
- ✅ **Tests** — testing agent ran 49 prior + 16 new P1 backend tests + 11 frontend scenarios, all PASS. New regression file: `/app/backend/tests/test_components_p1.py`.

## Phase 3 (P0 — paused per user) — Subscription Monetization
Pricing research now lives in `/app/memory/PRICING_RESEARCH.md`. Recommended starting tiers:
1. **Free**: 3 saved designs / week + public gallery (cap is the upgrade trigger).
2. **Hobbyist** (**$3/mo** or $30/yr): unlimited saves, 10 private designs, 100 voice commands/wk.
3. **Maker Pro** (**$7/mo** or $70/yr): unlimited private library, voice, verified-creator badge.
4. *(future)* **Studio** (~$19/mo): multi-user teams.
Stripe Checkout + a `users.tier` counter will implement this; awaiting user sign-off on the $3/$7 anchors before build.

## Iteration 14 (2026-02-20) — Edge Fillet & Chamfer
- ✅ **Edge fillet / chamfer for primitives** — cube, cylinder, and cone now support filleted (rounded) or chamfered (45° beveled) edges through a new "EDGE" panel in the Inspector. Two-button style toggle (Fillet ◜ / Chamfer ◢), radius slider clamped to the primitive's shortest half-extent, plus 4 quick presets (Off / 1 mm / 2 mm / 5 mm).
  - Stored on the object as `dims.edgeRadius` (number, mm) + `dims.edgeStyle` ("fillet"|"chamfer"). Defaults to 0 (sharp) so existing saved designs render unchanged.
  - Cube uses `RoundedBoxGeometry` (smoothness 1 → chamfer, 4 → fillet).
  - Cylinder uses a `LatheGeometry` built from a hand-rolled side profile so the top + bottom rims get a quarter-arc fillet or a single 45° chamfer.
  - Cone uses the same lathe approach on the bottom edge (apex stays a point); slope walks straight from the inset ring to the apex.
  - **Negatives included** — the Inspector UI isn't gated on modifier, so a filleted **negative** cube/cylinder/cone subtracts into the host model as a counter-bored pocket / chamfered recess in one shot (great for screw cup-points + heat-set inserts).
  - Picked up automatically by STL / 3MF / GCODE exports, CSG booleans, drop-to-bed, and the rotated-BBox compatibility checks because they all go through `buildGeometry`.
- New test IDs: `edge-controls`, `edge-style-fillet`, `edge-style-chamfer`, `edge-radius-slider`, `edge-radius-readout`, `edge-radius-preset-{0|1|2|5}`.
- Verified live with cube + cylinder + cone (positive and negative): chamfered cube shows clean 45° bevel; 5 mm fillet on cube rounds all 12 edges; cylinder chamfered/filleted top + bottom rims; cone base ring filleted and chamfered; negative cube exposes EDGE panel for counter-bore use.

## Iteration 15 (2026-02-20) — Help / User Manual
- ✅ **In-app User Manual** — new `HelpDialog.jsx` with a sidebar-nav + content layout reachable from a `?` icon in the top toolbar, the global <kbd>?</kbd> hotkey (anywhere in the workspace), or the voice event `open-dialog {name: "help"}`.
- ✅ **12 sections**: Index, Quick Start, Primitives, Positive & Negative, Transforms, Snapping & Grid, Fillet & Chamfer, Boolean Operations, Import & Export, Gallery & Sharing, Component Library, Voice Commands, Keyboard Shortcuts. Index page presents the sections as a 2-column card grid for at-a-glance navigation.
- ✅ **Voice Command Lexicon** — first-class section with hands-free flow walkthrough plus a 5-category × 28-entry phrase/effect table. Built-in search filter (`voice-lexicon-search` testid) narrows the table by phrase, action, or effect.
- ✅ **Keyboard Shortcuts** — full table including the new `?` hotkey to reopen the manual.
- ✅ **Search** — sidebar nav has its own topic search.
- Test IDs added: `help-btn`, `help-dialog`, `help-close-btn`, `help-nav-search`, `help-nav-<id>`, `help-card-<id>`, `help-section-<id>`, `voice-lexicon-search`, `voice-group-<category-slug>`.

## Iteration 16 (2026-02-20) — "Try it" Voice + Contributor Tier
- ✅ **"Try ▶" button on every voice example** — VoiceCommands section in the manual now renders a per-row Try button. Click pipes the literal phrase through the existing `parseTranscript` → `executeCommand` pipeline (same path the microphone uses), closes the help dialog, and surfaces the result in the bottom-of-screen banner. Verified live: clicking Try on `"Add a cube"` added a cube to the scene with toast `Voice: Added positive cube`.
- ✅ **Contributor Lifetime Tier (P1)** — new `GET /api/me/contributor-status` endpoint counts published+open-licensed components and designs (deduped on case-insensitive name), grants the `users.contributor_lifetime` flag the moment thresholds are crossed (100 components + 20 designs), and never demotes. The `/api/auth/me` payload now includes `contributor_lifetime` so the badge can light up app-wide.
  - Eligible licenses: CC0, CC-BY, CC-BY-SA, MIT, Apache 2.0, GPL/LGPL/AGPL. NC, ND, and Standard Digital excluded by design.
  - Profile page renders a dedicated `ContributorCard` with progress bars (`contributor-components` / `contributor-designs`), an "Earned" emerald badge once the milestone is hit, and a plain-English explainer.
  - Frontend uses `meApi.contributorStatus()` (lib/auth.js); failure is non-fatal (the rest of the profile still renders).
- Test IDs: `contributor-card`, `contributor-badge`, `contributor-components`, `contributor-designs`, `voice-try-<phrase-slug>`.

## Iteration 17 (2026-02-20) — Contributor Celebration Toast
- ✅ **Celebration toast on Contributor threshold** — when the backend flips `users.contributor_lifetime` to `true`, the next `/api/auth/me` (or Profile refresh) triggers a rich sonner toast: *"🏆 You're a ForgeSlicer Contributor for life!"* with a 12-second duration. Persisted per-user in `localStorage` (`forge.contributor.celebrated`) so it only celebrates once.
- ✅ Mounted shadcn `Toaster` in `App.js` (top-center, rich colors, dismiss button) so any component can `toast(...)` going forward.
- ✅ `Profile.jsx` triggers `refresh()` from AuthContext the moment a contributor-status fetch flips the flag, so the celebration fires on the same visit that crosses the threshold (instead of waiting for next sign-in).
- Verified live: forced `contributor_lifetime=true` in Mongo → Profile loaded → toast rendered at top-center with the trophy emoji.
- Note: kept toast-only for now; an actual transactional email would require adding SendGrid/Resend integration which is a separate iteration.

## Iteration 18 (2026-02-21) — Pre-Deploy Cleanup + Resend Email
- ✅ **Contributor celebration email via Resend** — wired transactional email send. Triggers exactly once, at the moment `users.contributor_lifetime` flips to `true` in `GET /api/me/contributor-status`. Send runs in `asyncio.to_thread` (non-blocking) and is best-effort (logs warning, never breaks the API response).
  - HTML email template with inline CSS (tables-based layout for max client compatibility), plain-text fallback, CTA back to `/profile`.
  - `RESEND_API_KEY` + `SENDER_EMAIL` + `APP_PUBLIC_URL` in `backend/.env`.
  - Currently using Resend's sandbox sender (`onboarding@resend.dev`); will switch to `contributor@forgeslicer.com` once DNS is verified post-launch.
  - Verified live: forced threshold cross with seeded data → email delivered, Resend message id `ce29e40e-...` returned.
- ✅ **Removed temporary `/api/download/source-zip` endpoint** + deleted `/app/forgeslicer-source.zip` (no longer needed; user is pushing via GitHub).
- ✅ New module `backend/email_service.py` (143 lines, lint clean) — kept isolated so future emails can register here.

## Iteration 19 (2026-02-21) — First-Sign-In Race Fix
- ✅ **Fixed "first sign-in fails, second succeeds" production bug** — `exchange_session` now retries the upstream GET to Emergent's auth-provider with exponential backoff (0.4 / 0.9 / 1.6 / 2.5 s; ~5.4 s worst-case) on transient failures (401, 404, 408, 425, 429, 5xx). The root cause: Emergent's auth provider has an eventual-consistency window for newly-issued `session_id`s; the first redirect-back GET could land before propagation completes. Retries fully cover that window.
- ✅ Verified live with a fake session_id → 4 retry attempts logged with `auth-provider attempt N returned M; retrying`, then proper 401 surfaced.
- Note: this is a **production-only bug** (preview didn't reproduce it because preview deployments use the same upstream provider but the user's session was already established). Production needs **redeploy** for the fix to take effect.

## Iteration 20 (2026-02-21) — Custom-Domain Cross-Origin Cookie Fix
- ✅ **Fixed the "signed in for a few seconds then loops back" production bug** on `forgeslicer.com`. Root cause: `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL` was baked into the production bundle as the original `*.emergent.host` URL. When users browse `forgeslicer.com`, the auth cookie is set on `forgeslicer.com` but every API call (including `/api/auth/me`) was hitting `emergent.host` — a different origin — so the browser never sent the cookie. Result: post-sign-in `/me` returns 401, AuthContext nulls the user, ProtectedRoute bounces, loop.
- ✅ `frontend/src/lib/api.js` now resolves the backend URL at runtime: if the page is being served from a different host than `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL`, it uses `window.location.origin` instead (keeps cookies first-party). Preview behavior unchanged (env host matches page host).
- Verified preview still renders cleanly. Production needs **redeploy**.

## Iteration 21 (2026-02-21) — AI Mesh Generation (Meshy AI)
- ✅ **Text-to-3D + Image-to-3D via Meshy AI** — new left-panel section "AI Generate" opens a beta dialog with two tabs:
  - **From Text** — prompt textarea (up to 600 chars) + 3 styles (realistic / sculpture / low-poly).
  - **From Image** — JPG/PNG/WebP upload up to 8 MB, base64-encoded and forwarded as data URL per Meshy spec.
- ✅ **Per-user monthly cap** — 13 generations / calendar month (Contributor Lifetime users get 26). Atomic `$inc` upsert in MongoDB so concurrent requests can't race past the boundary; failed submissions refund the counter.
- ✅ **Async job flow** — frontend polls `/api/ai/jobs/{id}` every 4 s with a 5-min timeout. Dialog shows live progress bar, success state with raw-Meshy download link, retry button, and clear error messages on failure or cap-reached.
- ✅ **Mesh import** — proxied download through backend (auth + CDN), routed into the existing `importAnyMeshFile` pipeline so AI meshes get auto-centered on the bed, the bbox computed, and the imported-mesh registration; toast confirms import.
- ✅ **GLB / GLTF import** added to `lib/exporters.js` (uses three.js GLTFLoader). Merges all sub-meshes into one geometry.
- ✅ **Help dialog** — new "AI Generate" section with usage tips, monthly-cap explainer, and a heads-up about thin walls / non-manifold AI meshes.
- 4 new backend endpoints: `GET /api/ai/usage`, `POST /api/ai/generate/text`, `POST /api/ai/generate/image`, `GET /api/ai/jobs/{id}`, `GET /api/ai/jobs/{id}/mesh`.
- Test-mode key `msy_dummy_api_key_for_test_mode_12345678` works for dev; production needs a real key from https://meshy.ai.
- Verified live end-to-end: prompt → SUCCEEDED → STL imported (1996×1381×1735 mm test mesh from Meshy's test fixture) → inspector + scale + slice tools all attached correctly.

## Iteration 22 (2026-02-21) — AI Sizing + In-Place Mirror + Cut Tool
- ✅ **AI mesh import sizing** — AI dialog success state now has "Auto-fit to bed" checkbox (default on; scales longest dim to 80% of printer's shortest build-volume axis) + optional manual "Target max dimension" override in mm. No more 2-meter dragons.
- ✅ **In-place Mirror** — new toolbar `MIRROR` button + popover with X/Y/Z axis choices. Flips the selected object(s) on the chosen axis by negating scale (no duplicate created). Useful for fixing asymmetric AI meshes. Atomic in undo history.
- ✅ **Cut tool (OrcaSlicer-style)** — new toolbar `CUT` button activates a cut mode with:
  - Yellow semi-transparent plane in the viewport with full transform-controls gizmo (move + rotate, 0.5mm + 5° snaps).
  - Floating Cut HUD at top of viewport with mode switcher, Reset, and three apply buttons: Keep Upper / Split (both) / Keep Lower.
  - CSG implementation in `csg.js#cutObjectByPlane` — builds two large half-space boxes positioned on the cutting plane and INTERSECTs each with the source. Handles arbitrary plane orientations (translates + rotates the half-space).
  - `store.applyCut(keep)` action replaces the source with up to two new "imported" objects; atomic in undo history. Empty pieces are silently dropped.
  - Toast on success/failure with piece count + per-object error details.
- ✅ Help dialog: new "Cut & Split" section + updated AI section explaining the auto-fit behavior.
- Verified live: cube → mirror X applied → cut HUD shown → Split (both) applied → "Cube (lower)" piece created.

## Iteration 23 (2026-02-21) — Cut Plane Bug Fix + AI Sizing UX
- ✅ **Fixed Cut tool axis mismatch** — `PlaneGeometry`'s default normal is +Z (vertical plane), but `cutObjectByPlane` assumed normal +Y. User reported "cut happens on the original axis, not the adjusted plane." Fix: rotate the `PlaneGeometry` -90° around X at construction so the visible plane is horizontal (normal +Y) by default — matching both user expectation and the CSG code's assumption. User-applied rotations now correctly tilt the cut axis.
- ✅ **Verified live**: 40mm cube + horizontal cut at Y=25 now produces **two** pieces (Cube upper 40×15×40 mm, Cube lower 40×25×40 mm). Previously only produced 1 piece due to the 90° mismatch.
- ✅ **AI dialog sizing UX overhaul**:
  - Moved sizing controls to BEFORE generation (in addition to the success state) so users know what size they'll get before pulling the trigger.
  - Replaced the checkbox + conditional input with two clear toggle buttons: "Auto-fit to bed" / "Specify size".
  - Auto-fit mode shows a live preview ("Longest dimension will be scaled to ~176 mm (80% of your printer's shortest axis: 220 mm)").
  - Manual mode has a clearer label + helper text ("The mesh's longest axis will be set to this size; other axes scale proportionally").
  - Extracted into a reusable `SizingControls` sub-component for DRY.

## Iteration 24 (2026-02-21) — AI Dialog Modal Safety
- ✅ **Fixed credit-loss bug** — user reported clicking outside the AI dialog or pressing Esc killed the in-flight Meshy job and burned the credit. Previous misleading copy ("The dialog stays open so you can keep working") implied the opposite.
- ✅ **Modal-lock during generation** — backdrop click + Esc are blocked while a job's status is PENDING/IN_PROGRESS. Top X button is hidden; bottom Close button is replaced by a "Working — please wait" spinner.
- ✅ **Honest in-progress copy** — amber warning text now says: *"Please keep this window open until the mesh arrives. Closing it (or clicking outside) before completion still uses your credit but you'll lose the result."*
- ✅ **Auto-resume on accidental close** — in-flight job_id + kind + poll deadline now persist in localStorage (`forge.ai.inflight`). If the dialog does close for any reason (browser crash, tab switch in mobile, etc.), reopening AI Generate auto-restores the job and resumes polling. Marker is cleared as soon as the job hits SUCCEEDED/FAILED.

## Iteration 25 (2026-02-21) — Splash Screen + Sidebar Tabs
- ✅ **Optional splash screen** — new `SplashScreen.jsx` fetches `/splash.html` on mount; if the file exists and the `<meta name="splash-version">` differs from the user's last-seen, displays the content for 30 s OR until OK click. Per-user localStorage so the same version doesn't pester returning users; bumping the version makes everyone see it again. Missing/empty splash file = no splash (graceful).
  - The splash HTML lives at `frontend/public/splash.html` and is just a marked-up `[data-splash]` block — no inline CSS needed; `App.css` `.splash-body` rules style any `[data-splash-*]` data attributes (eyebrow, title, lede, features, highlight, footer, kbd).
  - To edit: change the body content + bump the meta version string. To disable: empty the file.
- ✅ **Sidebar tabs** — `LeftPanel.jsx` refactored from a long vertical scroll list into a 4-tab strip at the top (3D / 2D / Combo / AI) over a single-section viewport. Outliner stays as its own scrollable region below. Tab choice persists in localStorage. Empty-state message updated to reference the tabs.
- Verified live: splash renders correctly with all data-attributes styled; OK button dismisses + records seen-version; tabs switch + persist across reload.

## Iteration 26 (2026-02-21) — AI Bug Fixes + Private Discoverability
- ✅ **Meshy 400 on Sculpture/Low-poly fixed** — text-to-3d v2 only accepts `art_style: "realistic" | "sculpture"`. `low_poly`/`low-poly` is invalid for text endpoint (it's an image-to-3d option). Removed "Low-poly" button (user can decimate in their slicer); added `enable_pbr: false` per Meshy docs (required for sculpture style). Backend `meshy_service.create_text_to_3d` now coerces unknown values to "realistic" so future UI mistakes can't hit a 400.
- ✅ **Transient 502 mid-generation fixed** — both `meshy_service.get_task` and `download_mesh` now retry transient 5xx (1s/2s/4s backoff, 3 attempts) before bubbling up. Frontend `pollOnce` also keeps retrying its own backend on transient errors until the 5-minute deadline, so a single hiccup no longer ditches an already-paid generation.
- ✅ **Private components/designs now discoverable** — Gallery's Designs + Components tabs gained a "Public / Mine" segmented filter (signed-in only). New backend `mine=true` query on `/api/gallery` and `/api/components` returns the caller's own items including private ones. Cards in "Mine" mode show a lock badge so users can tell at a glance what's private vs public. Closes the "saved private → can't find it later" loop the user reported.
- ✅ **Regression coverage** — added `backend/tests/test_mine_filter.py` (5 tests) verifying unauthenticated `mine=true` returns empty + public listings remain unchanged. 73/73 backend tests pass.
- Files: `meshy_service.py`, `server.py` (gallery+components list endpoints), `AIGenerateDialog.jsx`, `Gallery.jsx`, `lib/api.js`.

## Iteration 27 (2026-02-22) — Multi-method Auth (Email/Password + Magic Link + Reset)
- ✅ **Three sign-in methods now available** alongside the existing Google OAuth flow — all produce identical `session_token` httpOnly cookies + `user_sessions` rows, so every downstream endpoint works regardless of how the user signed in.
  - **Email + password** with bcrypt(12) hashing, 8+ char policy (letter + digit), brute-force lockout (5 fails / 15 min) on `<ip>:<email>`.
  - **Magic link** — passwordless one-time-use signed token, 15 min TTL, delivered via Resend.
  - **Forgot password** — Resend email with 60 min single-use token; reset invalidates ALL existing sessions (defense-in-depth).
- ✅ **Same-account merging**: Google users can attach a password by hitting `/register` with their existing Google email; `auth_methods` tracks which methods are wired up.
- ✅ **Profile editor with per-field privacy** (Profile.jsx) — optional `avatar_url`, `contact_link`, `city/state/country` each have an independent **Public / Private** checkbox. Defaults to PRIVATE; the user must explicitly opt-in per field. Owner always sees their own data via `/api/auth/me`.
- ✅ **Unified `/signin` page** with 3 tabs (Email · Magic link · Google). New aux routes: `/forgot-password`, `/reset-password?token=…`, `/magic-link?token=…`.
- ✅ **Security posture**: tokens stored as SHA-256 hash in MongoDB (DB dump can't take over accounts); no email enumeration on forgot/magic endpoints (always 200); explicit `auth_local.PASSWORD_RE` enforces server-side policy.
- ✅ **Test coverage**: 16 new tests (12 unit + 4 round-trip including session invalidation on password change). Total 89/89 backend tests pass.
- Files added: `backend/auth_local.py`, `backend/tests/test_local_auth*.py`, `frontend/src/components/SignIn.jsx`, `ForgotPassword.jsx`, `ResetPassword.jsx`, `MagicLinkLanding.jsx`.
- Files modified: `backend/server.py` (extracted `_set_session_cookie` + `_public_user`, mounted local-auth router, added `/api/me/profile`), `backend/email_service.py`, `frontend/src/components/Profile.jsx` (ProfileEditor), `App.js`, `ProtectedRoute.jsx`, `UserMenu.jsx`, `dialogs/SaveComponentDialog.jsx`, `dialogs/ShareDialog.jsx` (CTAs now point to `/signin`).

## Iteration 28 (2026-02-23) — Public Author Profiles + "What's New" Pin
- ✅ **Public author profile pages** at `/u/:userId` (P1 backlog item done) — clicking any "by …" link on a gallery card or component card now opens that maker's public profile, showing avatar / location / contact link **only if** the user enabled the corresponding `share_*` toggle. Always-public bits: display name, contributor-lifetime badge, and counts. Designs and components tabs show the full grid of public items (privacy enforced server-side — private items never appear).
- ✅ **Backend whitelist endpoint** `GET /api/users/:userId/profile` returns a strict, hard-coded set of fields — never `email`, never `password_hash`, never `last_login_at`, never `auth_methods`. Test suite explicitly asserts this. Plus `/users/:userId/designs` and `/users/:userId/components` for listing public items.
- ✅ **"What's new" pin in topbar** — small ✨ Sparkles button next to the Help icon dispatches a `forgeslicer:show-splash` window event. `SplashScreen` listens for it and replays the current announcement even if the user has dismissed this version. No state lifting needed — clean decoupling via DOM event.
- ✅ **Author name links** on gallery cards (designs + components) — `by {author}` is now a `<Link to="/u/{user_id}">` when the item has a `user_id`. Falls back to plain `<span>` for legacy items without ownership.
- ✅ **Help system updated** — added "Public author profile pages" paragraph in the Account section.
- ✅ **Test coverage**: 9 new tests (`test_author_profile.py`) including a "partial share only shows enabled fields" test that asserts toggles work independently. 100/100 backend tests pass.
- Files added: `backend/tests/test_author_profile.py`, `frontend/src/components/AuthorProfile.jsx`.
- Files modified: `backend/server.py` (3 new endpoints), `frontend/src/components/Gallery.jsx` (clickable author names), `SplashScreen.jsx` (event-driven re-open), `TopToolbar.jsx` (sparkles pin), `HelpDialog.jsx`, `App.js` (route).

## Iteration 29 (2026-02-23) — Admin Panel + AI Quota Overrides
- ✅ **Two-tier admin roles**:
  - **super_admin** — bootstrapped from `ADMIN_EMAILS` env var on each startup (idempotent). ONLY super-admins can promote/demote regular admins. Steve seeded as super-admin via `steve.shurts@gmail.com`.
  - **admin** — can do everything else: grant AI quota, grant Contributor-for-Life, ban users, force sign-out, view analytics, see audit log, moderate content.
- ✅ **Admin page at `/admin`** (security through obscurity — no link in nav, must know URL). Three tabs:
  - **Analytics** — Total/DAU/MAU users, new in 24h/7d/30d, contributor count, design + component totals (public + private), AI generations this month
  - **Users** — Searchable table with name/email/auth-methods/joined/last-login/AI-quota/AI-used/flags + per-row action buttons (toggle contributor, promote admin if super, force password reset, ban/unban)
  - **Audit log** — Every state-changing admin action recorded with timestamp, actor, action name, target, and JSON details payload
- ✅ **Per-user AI quota override** with **hard 300/month server-side ceiling** (`MAX_AI_QUOTA_OVERRIDE`). Click-to-edit cell on the user row: blank clears the override (default cap returns), 1-300 sets a custom monthly cap. Effective cap honored by `_ai_cap_for()` and reflected immediately in `/api/ai/usage`.
- ✅ **Soft-ban flow** — flagged users have all sessions killed instantly and `_resolve_session_token` refuses to honour stale tokens. Data preserved; ban is reversible.
- ✅ **Force-sign-out action** — kills every session for a user without touching their password. Useful for revoking access after credential leaks.
- ✅ **Content moderation** — `/api/admin/content/remove` soft-flags gallery / component items with `removed: true` and forces them private. Audit-logged.
- ✅ **Security guardrails**:
  - Pydantic field `quota: Optional[int] = Field(None, ge=1, le=300)` enforces 1-300 ceiling at the schema layer — even a compromised admin can't issue infinite gens.
  - Super-admins cannot demote themselves via the UI (lockout footgun protection).
  - Cannot ban a super-admin or yourself.
  - Removing an email from `ADMIN_EMAILS` doesn't auto-demote — must be done manually in Mongo (prevents env-var-typo lockouts).
  - Banned users' admin status doesn't grant access (`require_admin` checks ban state).
- ✅ **Test coverage**: 15 new admin tests (`test_admin.py`) — auth guards, 300-ceiling enforcement, audit log writes, ban-kills-sessions, super-vs-admin promotion gating, quota-clears-with-null. **115/115 backend tests pass.**
- Files added: `backend/admin.py`, `backend/tests/test_admin.py`, `frontend/src/components/AdminPage.jsx`, `frontend/src/lib/adminApi.js`.
- Files modified: `backend/server.py` (mounted admin router, ban-check in session resolution, ai_quota_override in `_ai_cap_for`, admin flags in `_public_user`), `backend/.env` (added `ADMIN_EMAILS`), `frontend/src/App.js` (added `/admin` route), `backend/tests/test_components_p1.py` (updated to reflect ADMIN_EMAILS now permanently set).

## Iteration 30 (2026-02-23) — CSV Export + Voice→AI Generation
- ✅ **Admin Users CSV export** — green Export button on the Users tab downloads `forgeslicer_users_<timestamp>[_search-xxx].csv` with 12 columns. RFC-4180 escaped, UTF-8 BOM prepended (Excel-friendly). Exports the currently-filtered set so admins can grab targeted slices by searching first.
- ✅ **Voice → AI Generation** — the intent parser (GPT-5.2) now understands `ai_generate` with two sub-modes:
  - **Auto-submit** when user says "**Generate** X" / "**Make** X **with AI**" / "**AI** X" — pre-fills + immediately submits (uses a credit).
  - **Pre-fill only** when user says "**I want to make** X **with AI**" — opens dialog with prompt populated, waits for click. Lets users review tone before committing a credit.
  - "**Open the AI generator**" (no subject) → opens dialog with empty prompt via existing `open` intent.
  - Parser test cases (live GPT-5.2): 5/5 correct including the exploratory/definitive distinction and a negative case ("Add a cube" doesn't get mis-classified).
- ✅ **Event-driven AI dialog** — `AIGenerateDialog` now listens for `forgeslicer:open-ai-generate` events with optional `{prompt, auto}` detail. Same hybrid pattern as the splash re-trigger — voice can open from anywhere in the app without prop-drilling.
- ✅ Help system updated: new "AI generation" voice lexicon category (5 example phrases), plus a "By voice" bullet in the AI Generate help section.
- Files modified: `backend/server.py` (VOICE_SYSTEM_PROMPT extended), `frontend/src/components/AIGenerateDialog.jsx` (event listener + auto-submit + unified close), `frontend/src/lib/voiceCommands.js` (ai_generate action handler), `frontend/src/components/HelpDialog.jsx` (lexicon + AI section), `frontend/src/components/AdminPage.jsx` (CSV export).

## Iteration 31 (2026-02-23) — Two-Row Toolbar + Help Discoverability Fix
- ✅ **Toolbar split into two rows** (user reported the help button was unreachable — root cause: single horizontal flex row crammed with ~25 buttons clipped the right side on narrower viewports).
  - **Row 1 (system)**: brand · file I/O · export · voice mic · project name · Gallery/Share/Component/Send-to-Slicer · ✨ What's new · ? Help · user menu
  - **Row 2 (object editing)**: booleans · transform gizmo · undo/redo/measure · Position/Rotation/Size/Duplicate/Mirror/Cut/Slicer popovers
- ✅ Subtle visual delineation: Row 2 has lighter background + thin top border so users intuit "edit controls" vs "system actions" without a label.
- ✅ Verified on 1440px viewport — help, what's-new, and user menu now visible with breathing room.
- File: `frontend/src/components/TopToolbar.jsx` (single file change, no breakage to Workspace layout — uses `flex flex-col` so the extra height auto-adjusts).

## Iteration 32 (2026-02-23) — Add Primitive Dropdown + Shareable Remix Links
- ✅ **Add Primitive dropdown** in Row 2 of the toolbar — 8 primitives (Cube/Sphere/Cylinder/Cone/Torus + 2D Circle/Square/Triangle) accessible without expanding the left palette.
- ✅ **`web+forgeslicer://` browser protocol handler** registered via `navigator.registerProtocolHandler` on first visit. Pastes of `web+forgeslicer://remix/<id>` URLs route into `/workspace?remix=<id>`.
- ✅ **Copy Share Link** button on every Gallery card. Composes `${origin}/workspace?remix=<id>` and writes to clipboard (falls back to prompt() if clipboard API blocked).
- Files: `frontend/src/components/TopToolbar.jsx`, `frontend/src/App.js`, `frontend/src/components/Gallery.jsx`.

## Iteration 43 (2026-02-25) — STL Auto-Repair (4-Pass Progressive Weld)
- ✅ **Auto-repair pass on import**: `geometryToManifold` now attempts four progressive weld tolerances (scaled to the model's bbox diagonal: 1e-7, 1e-5, 1e-4, 5e-4) before giving up. Most third-party STLs (Thingiverse, Printables, MakerWorld) have sub-micron gaps that fail manifold-3d's strict check on first construction — this fix transparently bridges those gaps. Replicates what OrcaSlicer / FlashForge "Repair" does, but invisibly.
- ✅ **Tolerance scales with model size**: a 1mm absolute gap is catastrophic on a 5mm earring but a rounding error on a 200mm Gridfinity tray — we use bbox-diagonal proportional tolerances so small parts don't get over-collapsed and large parts still close.
- ✅ **Manifold ✓ badge survives auto-repair**: when the repair pass succeeds (which is the common case), the resulting boolean output is still 100% watertight, so the Gallery badge persists. Only if all 4 passes fail does the worker fall back to BVH (and the badge isn't applied).
- ✅ **Tests**: new `tests/manifold-repair-smoke.mjs` builds a synthetic broken cube with mismatched corner vertices, confirms direct construction throws `NotManifold`, and confirms our progressive weld repairs it cleanly. Plus 9/9 existing manifold-smoke + 136/136 backend tests still green.
- ✅ Verified end-to-end on the running Preview build with a cube+sphere union → 89KB STL exported through the auto-repair-aware path with zero errors.
- ✅ Release notes bumped to v1.8.2.
- Files: `frontend/src/lib/manifoldEngine.js` (rewrote `geometryToManifold` + added `modelScale` helper), `frontend/tests/manifold-repair-smoke.mjs` (NEW), `frontend/src/lib/releaseNotes.js`.

## Iteration 42 (2026-02-25) — Imported STL Disappearance Fix
- 🔴 **User-reported bug**: imported Gridfinity base (cut down + boolean'd with cube + chamfers + 8 negative cylinders) showed up in the workspace but disappeared from the eye-preview, STL export, and 3MF export.
- 🔍 **Root cause**: `evaluateSceneAsync` (manifold-3d engine) was calling `buildObjectManifold` per object inside a `try/catch` that **silently** dropped any object manifold-3d rejected (NotManifold status on STLs with tiny topology defects — extremely common in third-party files). The worker's BVH fallback only kicks in when the WHOLE async eval throws, so partial rejections meant the bad object just vanished while everything else still rendered. Symptom matched user's report exactly.
- ✅ **Fix**: when `buildObjectManifold` rejects ANY positive OR negative, abort the entire manifold eval with a `MANIFOLD_REJECTED` error. The worker's `evaluateSmart` catches it and falls back to three-bvh-csg, which is more forgiving with imperfect imports. Same fix applied to `evaluateSceneByColorAsync` (3MF multi-color path).
- ✅ User confirmed fix works on their Tool Holder design.
- ✅ Release notes bumped to v1.8.1.
- Files: `frontend/src/lib/manifoldEngine.js`, `frontend/src/lib/releaseNotes.js`.

## Iteration 41 (2026-02-25) — Sketch / 2D Drawing Mode
- ✅ **Sketch mode**: full-screen 2D drawing overlay that turns user-drawn shapes into extruded scene objects. Toggled via the new `SKETCH` toolbar button in Row 2. Implemented as a `SketchOverlay` component mounted inside Workspace so it disappears the moment the user exits or commits.
- ✅ **Three drawing tools**:
  - **Pencil** — click to add polyline vertices, double-click or Enter to close. Dashed preview line follows the cursor between the last point and the hover position. ⌘Z undoes the last point, Esc cancels in stages.
  - **Rect** — drag from corner to corner, right-angled rectangle commits on release.
  - **Circle** — drag from center to set radius, approximated as a 48-segment polygon.
- ✅ **Build-plate-aware**: canvas renders an actual build plate (e.g. 220×220mm) with a 10mm grid, origin crosshair, and a live X/Z coords readout in the bottom corner. Points snap to a 1mm grid for precision.
- ✅ **New scene type `sketch`**: `buildShape2D` + `buildGeometry` + `getBaseSize` extended to handle arbitrary polygon point arrays. Sketches use the same `THREE.ExtrudeGeometry` pipeline as triangle/polygon primitives, so transforms, gizmos, drop-to-bed, mirror, cut, slicer, and STL/3MF export all work without further changes.
- ✅ **Positive / Negative modifier** selector in the sketch toolbar — same dual-use as the left palette. Negative sketches subtract from positives via the existing CSG engine.
- ✅ **Configurable extrude height** (default 5mm, min 0.5mm) — set per sketch right in the overlay before committing. Editable later in the Inspector.
- ✅ End-to-end verified: drew a rectangle → became an extruded scene object on the bed (71×5×35 mm), fully editable, listed in Outliner as "Sketch 1".
- ✅ Backend pytest: 136/136 passing (sketch work is frontend-only).
- ✅ Release notes bumped to v1.8.0.
- Files: `frontend/src/components/SketchOverlay.jsx` (NEW), `frontend/src/components/TopToolbar.jsx` (Sketch button + SketchButton component), `frontend/src/components/Workspace.jsx` (mount overlay), `frontend/src/lib/store.js` (`addSketch` + `sketchMode` state), `frontend/src/lib/geometry.js` (sketch shape + bbox), `frontend/src/lib/releaseNotes.js`.

## Iteration 40 (2026-02-25) — Stripe Integration + Manifold-async Migration + Remix Activity Feed

### Stripe billing (formerly "on hold")
- ✅ **Pricing page** at `/pricing` — Free / Maker ($50/yr) / Pro ($190/yr). Server-defined catalog (`/api/billing/packages`) is the single source of truth; frontend never sends amounts to Stripe.
- ✅ **Checkout flow**: `POST /api/billing/checkout` creates a Stripe session, persists a `payment_transactions` row with status="initiated", returns a checkout URL. Frontend hard-redirects to Stripe.
- ✅ **Success page** at `/billing/success?session_id=...` polls `GET /api/billing/status/{session_id}` (every 2s, up to 10 attempts) and grants the tier idempotently on `payment_status=paid`. AuthContext refreshes immediately so the new tier shows up across the UI without reload.
- ✅ **Webhook** at `POST /api/webhook/stripe` updates the transaction row as a backup confirmation channel — the primary tier grant runs on the polling path, but webhook ensures eventual consistency if the user closes the tab.
- ✅ **Tier persistence**: `user.subscription_tier` ("free" / "maker" / "pro") + `subscription_expires_at` (ISO timestamp 365 days from payment). Exposed on `/api/auth/me` for frontend gating.
- ✅ **UserMenu badge**: shows the current paid tier ("MAKER" / "PRO") next to the "Plans & Pricing" link for instant visibility.
- ✅ Uses Emergent's pre-provisioned `sk_test_emergent` key (no user credential collection needed). Test cards work end-to-end through real Stripe Sandbox.
- ✅ Tests: `backend/tests/test_billing.py` — 5/5 passing (catalog, unknown-package rejection, session creation, 404 on unknown session, default tier).

### Manifold-async migration (P2)
- ✅ Migrated `ContextMenu.Flatten` and `store.applyCut` from sync `three-bvh-csg` to the manifold-3d worker pipeline.
- ✅ Added `cutObjectByPlaneAsync` + `flattenObjectsAsync` to `workerClient.js`. Worker now exposes `cut-plane` and `flatten` job types alongside existing `combine` / `evaluate-stats` / `slice` / `stl-bytes` / `threemf-bytes`.
- ✅ Graceful fallback: each path catches manifold failures and falls back to BVH-CSG silently (with a console warning) so corrupted imports never hard-error.
- ✅ Workspace `handleApply` now `await`s the async `applyCut` and shows the busy state correctly during the heavier manifold compute.

### Remix activity feed (P3)
- ✅ New backend endpoint `GET /api/users/{user_id}/remix-activity` returns public gallery items that remixed any design owned by `user_id`, newest-first. Private remixes excluded; self-remixes filtered out.
- ✅ New "Activity (N)" tab on `AuthorProfile` (`/u/:userId`) — clean horizontal rows with thumbnail, "X remixed your Y as Z", relative time. Clicking a row opens that remix in `/workspace?remix=<id>`.

### Other
- ✅ Release notes bumped to v1.7.0 — three combined entries.
- ✅ Backend pytest: **136/136 passing**.
- Files: `backend/billing.py` (NEW), `backend/server.py` (router mount + me-endpoint tier fields + remix-activity route), `backend/.env` (STRIPE_API_KEY), `backend/tests/test_billing.py` (NEW), `frontend/src/components/PricingPage.jsx` (NEW), `frontend/src/components/BillingSuccessPage.jsx` (NEW), `frontend/src/components/UserMenu.jsx`, `frontend/src/App.js`, `frontend/src/components/AuthorProfile.jsx`, `frontend/src/lib/store.js`, `frontend/src/lib/workerClient.js`, `frontend/src/lib/workers/csg.worker.js`, `frontend/src/components/ContextMenu.jsx`, `frontend/src/components/Workspace.jsx`, `frontend/src/lib/releaseNotes.js`.

## Iteration 39 (2026-02-24) — Tier-(c) Hybrid Infill + GCODE Preview Viewer
- ✅ **Tier-(c) hybrid infill**: layers immediately above the bottom solid band AND immediately below the top solid band now use a BOOSTED density (midpoint between user sparse % and 100%). Bridges sparse → solid cleanly so the first/last solid layer doesn't sag into a low-density gap below/above. Configurable `transitionLayers` count (default 2, in Slicer popover).
- ✅ **GCODE Preview Viewer** (`GcodePreviewDialog.jsx`): scrubbable 2D top-down toolpath viewer. After every successful slice the Slicer popover gains a "Preview toolpaths layer-by-layer" button that opens a modal with a 560×560 canvas, prev/next layer buttons, play/pause loop (100ms/layer), and a range slider. Color legend: orange = extrusion, dim grey = travel. Per-layer stats show layer index, Z height, extrude move count, travel move count.
- ✅ **GCODE parser**: lightweight, handles G0/G1 with modal X/Y/Z, distinguishes extrusion (G1 with E) from travel, buckets moves at each `; LAYER:n` comment.
- ✅ Verified end-to-end on a 20mm cube: layer 1 (bottom solid) → 65 extrude moves rendering ±45° solid fill + perimeter; layer 51 (mid) → 16 extrude moves showing perimeter + ~6 sparse diagonal lines; layer 99 (top solid) → 65 extrude moves again. Auto-fit bounding box scales correctly to canvas.
- ✅ Release notes bumped to v1.5.0 — returning users will auto-see the new entry on next visit.
- ✅ Backend pytest: 131/131 passing.
- Files: `frontend/src/lib/slicer.js` (transition layer detection + boosted density), `frontend/src/lib/store.js` (added `transitionLayers`), `frontend/src/components/ActionPopovers.jsx` (transition field + Preview button wire-up), `frontend/src/components/GcodePreviewDialog.jsx` (NEW), `frontend/src/lib/releaseNotes.js` (v1.5.0 entry).

## Iteration 38 (2026-02-24) — Release Notes Dialog (replaces "What's New" splash)
- ✅ **New `ReleaseNotesDialog` component**: scrollable changelog modal with one entry per release (date, version chip, title, list of changes). Newest entry on top, full scroll history.
- ✅ **Change type chips**: each bullet is tagged with a colored chip — emerald **NEW** (feature), cyan **TWEAK** (improvement), rose **FIX** (bug fix). Visual at-a-glance scanning of what kind of change shipped.
- ✅ **Source of truth**: `frontend/src/lib/releaseNotes.js` — structured array of `{version, date, title, changes:[{type,text}]}`. New entries appended at the top with each release.
- ✅ **Auto-show on returning visitors**: localStorage `forge.releaseNotes.seen` tracks the last-acknowledged version. When that mismatches `latestReleaseVersion()`, the dialog auto-opens once. First-time visitors don't see it (they hit Landing).
- ✅ **Topbar `Sparkles` button rewired** from `forgeslicer:show-splash` → `forgeslicer:show-release-notes`. The legacy `SplashScreen` (one-off announcement banners via `splash.html`) is preserved separately for special events.
- ✅ End-to-end verified in Preview: 6 release entries (1.0.0 → 1.4.0) render correctly; scroll works; close + reload doesn't re-open; localStorage written.
- Files: `frontend/src/lib/releaseNotes.js` (NEW), `frontend/src/components/ReleaseNotesDialog.jsx` (NEW), `frontend/src/App.js` (mount), `frontend/src/components/TopToolbar.jsx` (rewire button).

## Iteration 37 (2026-02-24) — Tier-(b) Sparse Infill + GCODE Download UX
- ✅ **Sparse infill (Tier b)**: middle layers between the top/bottom solid bands now get sparse fill instead of being hollow. New settings: `infillPercent` (0–100%, slider) and `infillPattern` ("rectilinear" / "grid" / "gyroid"). Spacing scales inversely with density (100% = solid, 25% = 4× extrusion-width spacing, 0% = legacy perimeter cage).
- ✅ **Three patterns implemented**: rectilinear (alternating ±45°), grid (perpendicular crosshatch), gyroid (sampled implicit surface — strong & isotropic).
- ✅ **GCODE download UX clarity**: emerald confirmation card after every slice + a "Download `<file>` again" button that re-fires the download from a fresh user gesture (bypasses Chrome's silent-drop heuristic). Cached GCODE so re-download doesn't re-slice.
- ✅ **Header advertises infill**: e.g. `; ForgeSlicer 1.0 - GCODE (perimeters + 4 bottom / 4 top solid layers + 15% gyroid sparse infill)`.
- ✅ **End-to-end verified**: 20mm cube @ 15% density: middle-layer moves 16 (rectilinear) / 24 (grid) / 44 (gyroid) vs 8 (perimeter-only baseline) and 65 (solid bands). GCODE size scales appropriately.
- ✅ Backend pytest: 131/131 passing.
- Files: `frontend/src/lib/slicer.js`, `frontend/src/lib/store.js`, `frontend/src/components/ActionPopovers.jsx`.

## Iteration 36 (2026-02-24) — Top Toolbar Wraps on Narrow Windows + GCODE Download UX (Loose Ends)

## Iteration 35 (2026-02-24) — Solid Infill (Tier a) + Manifold ✓ Gallery Badge
- ✅ **Solid infill — Tier (a)**: top N and bottom N layers of every print are now fully solid via rectilinear ±45° fills (alternating per layer to bond cross-layer fibers). Middle layers stay perimeter-only (Tier b/c sparse infill is the next milestone).
- ✅ **New slicer settings**: `bottomLayers` (default 4) + `topLayers` (default 4) exposed in the Slicer popover as integer fields. Setting either to 0 reproduces the legacy perimeter-only output.
- ✅ **Algorithm**: scan-line fill with even-odd rule in a frame rotated by `-angleDeg`. Edges drop horizontal segments (no scan crossing), inset by ½ extrusion-width so fills bond to but don't overrun the perimeter. Spacing equals the extrusion width = 100% solid.
- ✅ **End-to-end verification in Preview**: sliced a 20mm cube → 99 layers, bottom/top each averaged **65 G1-extrude moves per layer** vs middle layers averaging **8 moves** (perimeter-only). Header advertises the configured counts.
- ✅ **"Manifold ✓" Gallery badge**: when an STL is exported through the manifold-3d worker pipeline (the default), the `manifold_verified=true` flag rides along with the upload. Gallery cards render an emerald `🛡 manifold` badge for verified items so remixers see quality at a glance. Backend GalleryItem model + create endpoint + list endpoint all surface the field.
- ✅ Worker (`csg.worker.js`) now stamps `manifoldVerified=true` on STL responses when manifold-3d succeeded, and `false` when it fell back to three-bvh-csg. `exportSTLBytesAsync` propagates this through to `ShareDialog`, which POSTs `manifold_verified` with the gallery item.
- ✅ **Tests added**: `backend/tests/test_gallery_manifold.py` covers POST default (False), POST true round-trip, and `me/designs` persistence. 3/3 passing. Backend full suite: 130 passing (voice-command test flakes occasionally on LLM non-determinism but passes in isolation).
- Files: `frontend/src/lib/slicer.js`, `frontend/src/lib/store.js`, `frontend/src/components/ActionPopovers.jsx`, `frontend/src/lib/workers/csg.worker.js`, `frontend/src/lib/workerClient.js`, `frontend/src/components/dialogs/ShareDialog.jsx`, `frontend/src/components/Gallery.jsx`, `backend/server.py`, `backend/tests/test_gallery_manifold.py`.

## Iteration 34 (2026-02-24) — Auth Bug Fix: R3F Overlay + CORS Wildcard
- 🔴 **User-reported bug**: "Runtime error with Google sign-in. Not persisting my sign-in from session to session. Can't log in with any method in incognito."
- 🔍 **Root cause #1 (Preview only)**: The `@emergentbase/visual-edits` babel plugin injects `x-line-number` / `x-file-name` debug attrs on every **lowercase** JSX element (line 1782 of its compiled plugin: `if /^[A-Z]/.test(elementName) return;`). React-Three-Fiber treats every prop as a Three.js property, so those `x-*` attrs crash R3F with `Cannot set "x-line-number"` and the CRA dev error overlay covered the entire sign-in form. User reports of "can't log in" stem from the overlay blocking interaction, NOT from broken auth.
- 🔍 **Root cause #2 (Production-relevant)**: Backend CORS middleware combined `allow_credentials=True` with `allow_origins=['*']`. Per CORS spec, browsers REFUSE to store/send cookies on responses that combine the wildcard origin with credentials. Same-origin requests (today's actual deploy topology) sidestep this, but if the user ever signed in via a cross-origin flow (e.g., Emergent Google Auth redirect from `auth.emergentagent.com`), the `session_token` cookie would be silently dropped.
- ✅ **Fix #1**: `craco.config.js` — disabled visual-edits via `FORGE_DISABLE_VISUAL_EDITS=true` flag, gated by an explicit constant so future contributors can re-enable when upstream adds R3F intrinsic exclusions.
- ✅ **Fix #2**: `backend/server.py` — replaced `allow_origins=['*']` with `allow_origin_regex` that reflects the specific request origin only when it matches `forgeslicer.com`, `*.preview.emergentagent.com`, `*.emergent.host`, or `localhost`. Disallowed origins get no `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header (browser blocks the response). Same-origin requests still work transparently.
- ✅ **End-to-end verification in Preview**: created a fresh account → redirected to `/workspace` → `session_token` cookie set with `Max-Age=604800; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=None` → full page reload → cookie still present → `/api/auth/me` returns 200 → user stays signed in.
- ✅ Backend pytest unchanged: 128/128 passing.
- Files: `frontend/craco.config.js`, `backend/server.py`.

## Iteration 33 (2026-02-23) — manifold-3d CSG Swap (Phase 1)
- ✅ **Installed manifold-3d 3.5.0** — Google's WASM-backed geometry library that guarantees manifold output (no open edges / slivers along boolean boundaries). Replaces `three-bvh-csg` as the **primary** CSG engine inside the Web Worker.
- ✅ **New module `frontend/src/lib/manifoldEngine.js`** exposes the same async surface as the existing worker client: `evaluateSceneAsync`, `evaluateSceneByColorAsync`, `combineTwoAsync`, `cutObjectByPlaneAsync`. WASM init is lazy, shared across calls, and works in both main-thread and worker contexts.
- ✅ **Worker (csg.worker.js) now uses manifold by default** with `three-bvh-csg` as a graceful fallback — if manifold throws on a corrupted import (e.g., NotManifold from a low-quality STL), the worker silently falls back so the user's project never breaks. Engine choice can be flipped at runtime via `{type:'set-engine', payload:{engine:'bvh'|'manifold'}}` for A/B regression debugging.
- ✅ **Bridge helpers** weld duplicate vertices (snap-to-grid 1e-4) before constructing Manifold meshes — three.js's BoxGeometry/SphereGeometry carry duplicate verts along UV seams, which manifold-3d would otherwise reject as `NotManifold`.
- ✅ **WASM hosting**: `manifold.wasm` (540KB) is copied to `frontend/public/manifold.wasm` via a yarn `postinstall` script so it's served from the app origin root. Worker locates it via `locateFile` callback so the worker scope resolves it correctly.
- ✅ **craco webpack patch** rewrites `node:module` etc. imports (manifold-3d's isomorphic Node code path) to plain specifiers + `resolve.fallback` empty modules, so webpack 5 builds without an `UnhandledSchemeError`.
- ✅ **Test coverage**: `frontend/tests/manifold-smoke.mjs` exercises cube/sphere/cylinder primitives, union/subtract/intersect, batched union, and `splitByPlane`. 9/9 passing. Backend pytest unchanged: 128/128 passing.
- ✅ **End-to-end verification in Preview**: added Cube + Sphere via the left palette, clicked STL → exported 91KB binary STL successfully routed through worker → manifold-3d → STLExporter.
- Files: `frontend/src/lib/manifoldEngine.js` (NEW, 354 lines), `frontend/src/lib/workers/csg.worker.js` (rewritten to dual-engine), `frontend/craco.config.js` (node-scheme replacement plugin), `frontend/package.json` (manifold-3d dep + postinstall), `frontend/public/manifold.wasm` (copied), `frontend/tests/manifold-smoke.mjs` (NEW).
- **Note**: main-thread sync callers (`exporters.js`, `ContextMenu.jsx` flatten, `store.js cutObjectByPlane`) still use `three-bvh-csg` since manifold's WASM init is async. Acceptable today because the worker is the primary execution path for every CSG-heavy user action (STL/3MF export, scene stats, Combine button, slicing). Future work: introduce async variants for the two remaining sync callers.

## Iteration 47 (2026-02-25) — AMS-aware GCODE Preview (Multi-material Slicer + Per-extruder Toolpaths)
- ✅ **Multi-material slicer**: `sliceToGCODE` now auto-detects scenes with 2+ distinct `colorIndex` groups and dispatches to a new `sliceMultiMaterialToGCODE` path. The new path uses `evaluateSceneByColor` to get per-color manifold geometries, then slices each colour's loops independently per layer with the existing solid/sparse/transition infill tier logic. Tool changes are emitted as `T<n>` lines + `; TOOL:n hex=#RRGGBB name=<n>` markers so downstream firmware and the in-app preview can both interpret them.
- ✅ **AMS color table** declared once in the GCODE header (`; AMS_TABLE T0=#E5E5E5 T1=#3182CE …`) so previewers/post-processors don't need to wait for the first tool change to learn the palette.
- ✅ **GCODE preview parser upgraded**: parses `AMS_TABLE`, `; TOOL:` markers, and explicit `T<n>` lines; attributes every G0/G1 move to its active tool; counts per-layer tool changes; records tool-change marker positions for visual overlay.
- ✅ **Preview canvas renders per-tool colours**: extrusion strokes batched per extruder so each material paints in its filament hex from the palette (white, black, red, green, blue, yellow, purple, orange). Tool-change markers drawn as small coloured rings at the changeover XY. Single-material prints fall back to the legacy orange/grey rendering — zero visual regression.
- ✅ **Per-tool legend with show/hide toggles**: when a print is multi-material, the dialog shows an `Extruders` legend with one chip per active tool (color swatch + `T<n> · <name>`). Clicking a chip hides that extruder's segments from the canvas, useful for inspecting a single colour layer-by-layer. An AMS badge in the dialog header advertises tool count.
- ✅ **Layer stats** now include a `Tool Chg` cell on multi-material prints so the user can see at a glance which layers swap filaments.
- ✅ **Tests**: `frontend/tests/ams-preview-smoke.mjs` covers AMS_TABLE palette ingestion, per-tool move attribution, tool-change counting, single-material no-regression, and implicit `T<n>` tool-change handling. 16/16 checks passing. Existing `manifold-smoke.mjs`: 9/9. Backend pytest: untouched (no backend changes for this feature).
- Files: `frontend/src/lib/slicer.js` (multi-material slice path), `frontend/src/components/GcodePreviewDialog.jsx` (parser + per-tool rendering + legend), `frontend/tests/ams-preview-smoke.mjs` (NEW).

## Iteration 49 (2026-05-26) — OrcaSlicer Engine Integration (Phase 1) + Right-Panel Tabs + Voice Fixes

### OrcaSlicer Engine (Phase 1 — backend skeleton + UI selector + background compile)
- ✅ **Backend**: New `backend/orca_engine.py` module exposing `/api/slice/orca/status` (cheap, no fork — reports install location, arch, version, build-in-progress flag) and `/api/slice/orca/slice` (POST STL+profiles → shells out to OrcaSlicer CLI → returns extracted GCODE + stats). Hard 5-min timeout, 50 MB STL cap, per-request temp dir cleanup.
- ✅ **Binary resolution** walks: `$ORCA_BIN` → `/app/backend/bin/orca-aarch64/OrcaSlicer` → `/app/backend/bin/orca-x86_64/OrcaSlicer` → `PATH`. Persistent install survives container restarts.
- ✅ **Frontend Engine picker** in `ActionPopovers.SlicerPopover`: two-tile selector (Built-in · in-browser | OrcaSlicer · server-side) with live install-status detail line. Built-in remains default; Orca tile is disabled with "installing…" spinner + explanation when the server reports `build_in_progress`. Choice persists in localStorage. `orcaApi.{status,slice}` added to `lib/api.js`.
- ✅ **Helper**: `arrayBufferToBase64` chunked encoder for large STL uploads (avoids the spread-into-fromCharCode stack overflow on 1MB+ buffers).
- ✅ **Tests**: `backend/tests/test_orca_engine.py` — status returns well-formed payload; slice returns 503 with helpful detail when engine missing. 2/2 passing.
- 🟡 **Phase 2 in progress**: ARM64 source compile of OrcaSlicer v2.3.2 running in background under `/opt/orca-build/`. Build output checked into `/app/backend/bin/orca-aarch64/` on success (`/app` is the persistent volume so the binary survives restarts). Currently at OpenSSL compile (~dep #110/193, ~1.5 GB into expected 5-8 GB). Expected completion: ~1-2 hours from initial launch.
- 🔵 **Phase 3 (queued)**: x86_64 production fallback — fetch official AppImage at backend startup, `--appimage-extract`, drop into `bin/orca-x86_64/`. Backend already routes via `platform.machine()`.

### Right Panel → tabbed (Inspect / Print / Health)
- ✅ Three persisted tabs matching the LeftPanel pattern. Inspect = selected-object editor + scene stats; Print = printer/filament + compatibility warnings; Health = manifold checks. Reduces visual density and selection persists in localStorage. (`RightPanel.jsx`)

### Voice control fixes
- ✅ **Adaptive VAD threshold** (`whisperStt.js`): samples ambient noise for 600 ms then locks speech threshold at `floor + 10 dB` (capped at −55 dB). Replaces the fixed −45 dB cutoff that left quiet rooms / low-gain mics stuck on "Listening…" forever.
- ✅ **Hard 12-s record cap** in `VoiceButton.jsx` — even if VAD never trips, the listener auto-finishes so the UI can never hang.
- ✅ **Whisper hallucination filter** — known silence artefacts ("you", "Thank you.", "Thanks for watching", "[music]", "...") collapse to empty string so users get "No speech detected" instead of bogus commands. 15/15 smoke checks (`tests/voice-hallucination-smoke.mjs`).

### Other fixes
- ✅ Release-note dates corrected (Feb → May 2026 — system clock confusion on my end).
- ✅ SVG import strips background-fill rectangles automatically and carves letter holes as negative siblings (logos now read properly, no more orange slab). 7/7 smoke checks against the user-submitted SWS Logo.
- ✅ Share + Save Component dialogs fully reset all fields on every open (description was sticking).

### Files touched
- `backend/orca_engine.py` (NEW), `backend/server.py` (router mount), `backend/tests/test_orca_engine.py` (NEW)
- `frontend/src/components/ActionPopovers.jsx` (Engine picker), `frontend/src/lib/api.js` (orcaApi), `frontend/src/components/RightPanel.jsx` (tabs), `frontend/src/components/VoiceButton.jsx` (cap), `frontend/src/lib/whisperStt.js` (adaptive VAD + hallucination filter), `frontend/src/lib/svgImport.js` (background strip + holes), `frontend/src/components/SVGImportDialog.jsx` (holes UI), `frontend/src/components/dialogs/ShareDialog.jsx` & `SaveComponentDialog.jsx` (reset on open), `frontend/src/lib/releaseNotes.js` (1.10.0 entry)
- `frontend/tests/voice-hallucination-smoke.mjs` (NEW), `frontend/tests/svg-import-smoke.mjs` (NEW), `frontend/tests/ams-preview-smoke.mjs` (NEW + fixture `tests/fixtures/sws-logo.svg`)

## Backlog / Future Enhancements
- P0: **OrcaSlicer Phase 2** — verify the ARM64 compile finishes successfully and the binary slices a test STL end-to-end. Re-deploy.
- P0: **OrcaSlicer Phase 3** — x86_64 production AppImage extraction at backend startup.
- P1: **OrcaSlicer profile editor UI** — surface printer/process/filament JSON fields so users can dial in supports / multi-perimeter count / ironing without leaving the dialog.
- P2: Migrate the two remaining main-thread sync CSG callers (`ContextMenu.flatten`, `store.cutObjectByPlane`) to manifold-3d async — minor UX refactor (small "Computing…" state) but unifies the engine across all execution paths.
- P2: Curve/extrude primitives
- P2: `forgeslicer://` URL protocol companion app
- P2: Further refactor `ContextMenu.jsx` + `TopToolbar.jsx`
- P2: Stripe subscription tiers (PRICING_RESEARCH.md ready) — ✅ done
- P3: Sketch / 2D drawing mode — ✅ done
- P3: AMS-aware preview — ✅ done (Iteration 47)
- P3: Remix activity feed on Profile (who remixed your designs, when) — ✅ done


## Iteration 1.14 (2026-02-27) — Popover refactor + Rotation/Position regression closed
- ✅ **Verified Rotation ≠ Position popover bug is gone** — live preview shows the Position popover renders X/Y/Z mm fields and the Rotation popover renders X/Y/Z ° fields + Drop-to-Bed. Previous agent's TopToolbar refactor already resolved it; no further patch needed.
- ✅ **Split `ActionPopovers.jsx` (991 lines) into `components/popovers/`** — one file per popover:
   - `PopoverShell.jsx` — shared `PopoverShell` + `NumberField` + `EmptyMsg` primitives
   - `PositionPopover.jsx`, `RotationPopover.jsx`, `ScalePopover.jsx`
   - `DuplicatePopover.jsx`, `MirrorPopover.jsx`, `SlicerPopover.jsx`
   - `OrcaProfileEditor.jsx` — extracted from inside SlicerPopover
   - `index.js` — barrel for `TopToolbar` import
- ✅ `ActionPopovers.jsx` shrunk to a 7-line re-export shim for backward compat.
- ✅ Smoke test verified all 6 popovers (position / rotation / scale / duplicate / mirror / slicer) render unique testids on click.

### Files touched
- `frontend/src/components/popovers/` (NEW directory, 8 files)
- `frontend/src/components/ActionPopovers.jsx` (reduced to re-export shim)
- `frontend/src/components/TopToolbar.jsx` (import path updated)

## Iteration 1.27 (2026-02-27) — OrcaSlicer profile-JSON metadata fix (exit 251)
**Production bug**: User clicked Slice & Export GCODE in OrcaSlicer mode and got
`OrcaSlicer exited with code 251: operator():file /tmp/orca-XXX/printer.json's from unsupported (HTTP 500)`.

**Root cause**: OrcaSlicer's CLI strictly validates the JSONs it loads — every profile must carry four required metadata fields (`type`, `name`, `from`, `instantiation`). We were sending just the slicer-param keys (`nozzle_diameter`, `printable_area`, etc.). Without the metadata, the C++ validator threw `operator():file X.json's from <empty> is unsupported (rc=251)`.

**Fix shipped (preview-only, needs redeploy for prod)**:
- ✅ `buildOrcaPayload()` now wraps every output profile with the four required metadata fields:
   - `type` = `"machine" | "process" | "filament"`
   - `name` = the human label
   - `from` = `"User"`
   - `instantiation` = `"true"` (string, not bool — Orca expects a string)
- ✅ Friendly error mapping in `orca_engine.py`: when stderr matches `operator():file X.json's from ... unsupported`, the slice endpoint now returns **400** with "OrcaSlicer rejected printer.json — the profile JSON is missing required metadata" instead of the raw C++ trace.
- ✅ **22-check unit test** (`tests/orca-profile-meta.mjs`) verifies every profile carries metadata + tunables override correctly + unknown IDs fall back. All passing.

### Files touched
- `frontend/src/lib/orcaProfiles.js` — `buildOrcaPayload` adds `withMeta()` wrapper
- `backend/orca_engine.py` — slice endpoint maps the profile-validation pattern to a clean 400
- `frontend/tests/orca-profile-meta.mjs` (NEW) — regression coverage

### To restore OrcaSlicer on prod
Redeploy. After redeploy, the same workflow (group interlocking cubes → OrcaSlicer engine → Slice & Export) should now produce real Orca GCODE.

## Iteration 1.26 (2026-02-27) — TODO ADDED (not yet fixed)
**Slider value-bubble overflow in Slicer popover**: When a value indicator (e.g. `2` walls, `15%` infill) is rendered, it can appear *underneath an adjacent control to its right* or *escape the popover boundary entirely* when the popover is anchored near the right edge of the viewport. Reported by user against production.

**Where to look**:
- `frontend/src/components/popovers/SlicerPopover.jsx` — `bg-slate-950 ... flex-shrink-0` slider rows for Infill (`%`)
- `frontend/src/components/popovers/OrcaProfileEditor.jsx` — same pattern for Perimeters (`walls`) and Infill density (`%`)
- `frontend/src/components/popovers/PopoverShell.jsx` — viewport-edge clamping in `setPos`

**Likely fix**:
- The slider rows use `flex items-center gap-X` with `flex-1` on the input — the value span at the end may be overflowing on narrow popover widths
- Or browser default value-bubble on `<input type="range">` is escaping
- The PopoverShell's `width` parameter (340 px for Slicer) may need a max-width clamp against the viewport
- Add `overflow-hidden` or `min-w-0` to the slider row to contain the bubble

**Action**: Investigate in a screenshot test (right-column position + ultrawide + narrow viewports), then patch.

## Iteration 1.25 (2026-02-27) — Slicer popover status polling (UI didn't refresh after install completed)
**Diagnosis**: User saw "installing…" forever on production even though `/api/slice/orca/status` returned `installed: true` (verified via browser DevTools). The OrcaSlicer install actually succeeded — but the frontend only fetched status ONCE on mount and never refreshed.

**Fix**:
- ✅ `SlicerPopover.jsx` now polls `/api/slice/orca/status` every 5 s while `installed` is still false (AND the user is on a supported arch). Stops polling automatically once installed flips true.
- ✅ Transient network errors also re-try (10 s backoff) — no need to close/reopen the popover.

**For the existing stuck UI**: a single hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) clears the stale client state immediately, no redeploy required.

### Files touched
- `frontend/src/components/popovers/SlicerPopover.jsx`

## Iteration 1.24 (2026-02-27) — Stale-lock cleanup + status-detail debug info
- ✅ `_install_in_progress()` ignores + auto-cleans lock files older than 15 min so a crashed install can't permanently jam the UI.
- ✅ Status detail surfaces lock-file age when an install runs longer than 5 min ("612 s elapsed").
- ✅ New pytest test covers the stale-cleanup path. 11/11 passing.

### Files touched
- `backend/orca_engine.py` — stale-lock guard + age-aware detail messages
- `backend/tests/test_install_orca.py` — `test_install_in_progress_clears_stale_lock`

## Iteration 1.23 (2026-02-27) — OrcaSlicer system-deps fix (prod libEGL error)
**Production bug**: User reported on https://forgeslicer.com that switching to the OrcaSlicer engine and slicing produced `libEGL.so.1: cannot open shared object file (exit code 127)`. Built-in slicer worked fine.

**Root cause analysis**:
- Used `readelf -d` on the v2.3.2 binary inside the AppImage. Confirmed it has ~30 `NEEDED` shared libraries — libEGL, libGL, libgtk-3, libwebkit2gtk-4.1, libpango, libcairo, libgstreamer, libsoup, libsecret, etc.
- The AppImage ships ONLY `bin/orca-slicer` and `AppRun`. ZERO bundled `.so` files. The binary expects the host system to have the entire GTK+OpenGL+WebKit stack installed.
- The production container has none of these — it was built for a Node/Python web stack, not a GUI app's runtime.

**Fix shipped**:
- ✅ **NEW `scripts/install_orca_deps.sh`** — apt-get installs the 30-package runtime dep list (libegl1, libgl1, libgtk-3-0, libwebkit2gtk-4.1-0, libpango-*, libcairo*, libgstreamer*, libsoup-3.0-0, etc.). Idempotent — uses `dpkg-query` to skip already-installed packages, ~50 ms when satisfied. Skips cleanly if not root or apt-get not present.
- ✅ **Wired into 2 places**: invoked once from `install_orca.py` before extracting; invoked again on every backend startup via a separate `server.py` hook so already-installed boxes still get fixed.
- ✅ **Resolver fix**: `_resolve_appimage_entry()` now includes `bin/orca-slicer` as a candidate (the AppImage v2.x actual layout) — was previously missing it; only worked through AppRun.
- ✅ **Friendly slice-error mapping**: when `stderr` contains `error while loading shared libraries`, the slice endpoint extracts the missing lib name with regex and returns a **503 with actionable detail** ("library 'libEGL.so.1' is missing — run `install_orca_deps.sh`") instead of a raw 500 trace.
- ✅ **README.md** updated with the full Dockerfile snippet (recommended) so the deps are baked in at image-build time.
- ✅ **2 new pytest tests**: AppImage layout candidate (`bin/orca-slicer`) detection; existing 12-test suite still passes.

### Files touched
- `backend/scripts/install_orca_deps.sh` (NEW) — apt-get-based system-deps installer with idempotency, age-aware apt-list refresh, clear logging
- `backend/scripts/install_orca.py` — calls `_ensure_system_deps()` before AppImage extract; adds `bin/orca-slicer` candidate in `_pick_entrypoint`
- `backend/orca_engine.py` — `_resolve_appimage_entry` recognises real v2.x layout; slice endpoint returns 503 + actionable detail for missing-lib errors
- `backend/server.py` — `_run_orca_deps` worker fires the deps script on every startup
- `backend/scripts/README.md` — system-deps documentation + Dockerfile recommendation
- `backend/tests/test_install_orca.py` — new test for `bin/orca-slicer` resolver path

## Iteration 1.22 (2026-02-27) — Voice command palette + Go-mode wait/resume
- ✅ **Voice command palette**: new `BookOpen` icon button next to the Voice mode chevron opens a 360px popover with 11 categorized sections of example phrases (primitives, transform, selection, duplicate, booleans, history, group, gizmo mode, export, AI mesh, Go-mode controls). Categories are individually collapsible with persistent state, and the palette closes on click-outside / Esc / explicit X. Hidden by default — zero permanent screen real estate.
- ✅ **Wait/Resume in Go mode** — addresses "let me take a measurement" / "let me look something up" workflows:
   - **Pause phrases** ("wait", "wait a sec", "pause", "hold on", "one moment", "give me a sec", "hang on", "one sec") — recognised as the WHOLE utterance only; spoken as a command, they enter the paused state instead of running.
   - **Paused state**: mic stays open in keyword-listen mode with longer silence tolerance (1.5 s vs 0.9 s) so brief ambient sounds don't trigger transcription. Each cycle ≤4.5 s. Only `resume` / `continue` / `ready` / `i'm back` / `go again` / `let's continue` / `go ahead` / `start again` re-engage the loop. Any other speech is silently discarded and the listen cycle restarts.
   - **Hard cap**: 2-minute pause limit prevents accidental forever-recording. Auto-exits Go mode with a warning toast.
   - **Manual escape**: clicking the Voice button while paused = manual resume (escape hatch for noisy environments where voice-resume can't be heard).
   - **Disjoint regex sets** — pause / resume / exit are mathematically verified non-overlapping; no phrase ambiguously matches more than one.
- ✅ **Visual states**: yellow Pause icon + "Resume" label on the Voice button while paused; yellow-bordered banner with the resume phrase list; localized banner text.

### Files touched
- `frontend/src/components/VoiceCommandPalette.jsx` (NEW) — 11-category collapsible cheatsheet popover with persistence
- `frontend/src/components/VoiceButton.jsx` — adds `enterGoPause`, `beginGoPauseListen`, `finishGoPauseListen`, `resumeGoMode`, pause/resume regex classifiers, paused-state banner + button visuals
- `frontend/src/components/toolbar/SystemRow.jsx` — mounts `<VoiceCommandPalette />` next to `<VoiceButton />`

## Iteration 1.21 (2026-02-27) — Voice latency cut + new "Go" continuous mode
- ✅ **Latency fixes** (single-shot mode improves too): VAD silence trigger 1500 → 900 ms, grace pause 2000 → 600 ms, confirm-silence 1000 → 700 ms. Typical mic-to-result time: **~10 s → ~6-7 s**.
- ✅ **Added "Go mode"** — continuous hands-free voice loop, no confirmation step. After each command runs, mic auto-reopens for the next utterance. Typical mic-to-result time in Go mode: **~3 s** (skips the entire confirmation Whisper round-trip).
- ✅ **Mode picker UI**: small chevron dropdown next to the Voice button → two-option menu (Single Command / Go Mode) with persistent `localStorage` storage. A subtle "GO" badge on the Voice button when Go mode is selected so it's discoverable without opening the menu.
- ✅ **Exit phrases for Go mode**: `"stop"`, `"done"`, `"exit"`, `"cancel"`, `"quit"`, `"end voice"`, `"stop listening"`, `"i'm done"`, plus variants like "exit go mode". Regex-tested to NOT false-trigger on commands containing those words (e.g. "stop the slicer" → still a command, "cancel my last operation" → still a command).
- ✅ **Idle exit**: 20 s of no-speech in Go mode → automatically ends the loop so the mic indicator doesn't pulse forever if the user walks away.
- ✅ **Visual state**: Voice button gains an orange Zap icon + "Voice · Go" label while Go mode is actively running; the banner shows a one-line hint about how to exit ("Say 'stop' or click Voice to end Go mode").

### Files touched
- `frontend/src/components/VoiceButton.jsx` (rewritten — adds mode state, Go-loop scheduler, exit-phrase classifier, chevron menu, reduced timeout constants)

## Iteration 1.20 (2026-02-27) — Light/Dim active-state legibility fix
- ✅ **Fixed**: in light mode, the active state of toolbar pills + theme switcher segments + the pin toggle was `text-orange-300` on `bg-orange-500/20` — pale-orange text on pale-orange background, near-illegible.
- ✅ **Solution**: targeted `[data-theme="light"]` overrides in `themes.css` that darken `text-orange-100/200/300/400` to orange-700/800 and bump the highlight fill from 20% → 28% opacity. Dark + Dim modes are completely untouched.
- ✅ Also pre-emptively darkened light-mode accent texts that exhibited the same low-contrast pattern: `text-emerald-200/300`, `text-amber-300/400`, `text-purple-100/200/300`, `text-green-300`, `text-red-400`, `text-cyan-400` — used by Slicer engine cards, save-component confirmation, and multi-select badges.
- ✅ Computed-style verification: light-mode active = `rgb(194,65,12)` orange-700 / 28% tint; dark + dim = `rgb(253,186,116)` orange-300 / 20% tint (unchanged).

### Files touched
- `frontend/src/styles/themes.css` — one new block under `[data-theme="light"]` for orange + accent text remaps

## Iteration 1.19 (2026-02-27) — OrcaSlicer AppImage installer (auto on backend startup)
- ✅ **`scripts/install_orca.py`** — downloads the latest OrcaSlicer Linux AppImage from the official `SoftFever/OrcaSlicer` GitHub release, self-extracts via `--appimage-extract` (no FUSE), and stages the result at `/app/backend/bin/orca-x86_64/`. Idempotent — running on an already-installed host is a sub-100 ms no-op. Honors `--force` and `--dry-run`.
- ✅ **Auto-run on backend startup** (`server.py` `@app.on_event("startup")`): if no working binary is resolved, fires the installer in a background thread. Non-blocking — backend serves traffic immediately, engine becomes available once install (~30-60 s on x86_64) finishes. On aarch64 the installer cleanly skips with rc=1 (no AppImage published for ARM).
- ✅ **Resolver supports both flows**: `_resolve_appimage_entry()` prefers `AppRun` (AppImage launcher with bundled LD_LIBRARY_PATH) and falls back to `OrcaSlicer` / `usr/bin/OrcaSlicer` so a future source-build also works.
- ✅ **Arch-aware status detail** — on aarch64 hosts the status endpoint surfaces "OrcaSlicer ships an x86_64-only AppImage; this server is aarch64" instead of the generic "not installed" message.
- ✅ **Lock file sentinel** (`bin/.orca_install_lock`) so the status endpoint can report `build_in_progress: true` while a concurrent install is running. UI already displays an "installing…" pill on this state.
- ✅ **9 new pytest unit tests** in `test_install_orca.py` exercising asset-picker, arch check, env-override, on-aarch64 skip path, AppRun preference, nested binary fallback, and lock-file detection. All passing.
- ✅ **`.gitignore` entries** for `backend/bin/orca-*/` + `backend/bin/.cache/` so the ~280 MB extracted binary is downloaded per-deploy rather than committed.
- ✅ **`backend/scripts/README.md`** documents the install flow, manual operations, disk usage, status endpoint payload, and the AppImage-vs-source-build tradeoff.

### Files touched
- `backend/scripts/install_orca.py` (NEW) — full installer with download, extract, idempotency, lock file, arch detection
- `backend/scripts/README.md` (NEW) — deploy ops documentation
- `backend/orca_engine.py` — `_resolve_appimage_entry`, `_install_in_progress`, updated `resolve_install`, arch-aware status detail
- `backend/server.py` — startup hook + thread-pool runner for the installer
- `backend/tests/test_install_orca.py` (NEW) — 9 unit tests
- `/app/.gitignore` — entries for the binary cache + extracted tree

### Production verification
This preview pod is aarch64 — the install pipeline is exercised through download + GitHub API + asset picker + lock file, but the final binary cannot run here. **Production x86_64 hosts will install + verify end-to-end on first backend boot** (~30-60 s) and surface the engine immediately. No manual intervention required after merging.

## Iteration 1.18 (2026-02-27) — Per-route theme memory
- ✅ **Optional pin toggle** added next to the theme switcher (Pin / PinOff icon). When pinned, the theme switcher writes to a per-route slot instead of the global default.
- ✅ Storage: `forgeslicer.theme.perRoute` (1/0) + `forgeslicer.theme.routes` (JSON `{ path → choice }` map). Path keys are normalized to the top-level segment (`/workspace`, `/gallery`, `/u`, …) so users don't end up with a different theme per gallery item.
- ✅ **Route-change reactivity** wired in `AppRouter` via `useLocation` → `useTheme.setRoute(pathname)`. When pin is ON and the route has a saved theme, it re-applies on navigation without a reload.
- ✅ **Toggling pin ON seeds the current route** with the user's *global choice* (not the resolved value) so pinning a page in Auto mode stays Auto — a tiny but important detail.
- ✅ **Switcher mounted on Landing, Gallery, Profile** (alongside the existing Workspace mount) so users can change/pin themes from any route.
- ✅ **Bootstrap-aware**: `bootstrapTheme()` reads the per-route map and the current `location.pathname` at boot, so the first paint already reflects a pinned route's theme on direct page load.
- ✅ Smoke test verified 7-scenario flow: global=Light → navigate to /workspace → pin → change to Dark → navigate to /gallery (still Light) → back to /workspace (Dark restored) → reload (Dark persists). Independent and idempotent.

### Files touched
- `frontend/src/lib/theme.js` (rewrote — adds `routeThemes`, `perRouteEnabled`, `setRoute`, `togglePerRoute`, `normalizeRoute`)
- `frontend/src/components/toolbar/ThemeSwitcher.jsx` (adds Pin button, reads active-segment from effective theme)
- `frontend/src/App.js` (subscribes to `useLocation` and calls `setRoute`)
- `frontend/src/components/Landing.jsx`, `Gallery.jsx`, `Profile.jsx` (mount ThemeSwitcher in header)

## Iteration 1.17 (2026-02-27) — One-time "Auto theme is on" hint toast
- ✅ Added a **one-time toast** on first launch for brand-new visitors: "Auto theme is on — We're following your system appearance. Tap the sun/moon icons in the toolbar to override." with a "Got it" action and 8s auto-dismiss.
- ✅ **Gated tightly** — fires only when (a) user has *no* stored theme choice AND (b) `forgeslicer.theme.hintSeen` localStorage flag isn't set. Mounted with a 2.5s delay so it doesn't compete with the splash screen / auth redirects.
- ✅ "Got it" click, swipe-dismiss, and auto-close all mark the hint as seen — so it never re-appears regardless of how the user dismisses it.
- ✅ Smoke test verified: appears once for new user → never again on reload → never shown to returning users with a pre-existing stored theme.

### Files touched
- `frontend/src/lib/theme.js` (added `shouldShowThemeHint()` / `markThemeHintSeen()` + module-load capture of pre-bootstrap stored value)
- `frontend/src/App.js` (delayed `useEffect` fires the toast)

## Iteration 1.16 (2026-02-27) — System / Auto theme mode (new default)
- ✅ **Added `system` mode** (icon: MonitorCog, label: Auto) — follows `(prefers-color-scheme: light)` media query. Now the default for brand-new users.
- ✅ **Live OS updates**: A `matchMedia` listener installed at module load re-resolves the theme when the user flips their OS appearance while the tab is open. Listener only acts when stored choice is `"system"` — explicit Dark/Dim/Light picks are never overridden by OS changes.
- ✅ **Store now exposes `theme` (user choice incl. `system`) AND `resolvedTheme` (concrete `dark|dim|light` actually rendered)**. Viewport canvas reads `resolvedTheme` so Auto mode flows through to the 3D scene background too.
- ✅ Switcher tooltip on the Auto button shows the currently-resolved mode (`"… — currently light"`).
- ✅ Smoke test verified all 6 scenarios: default → system; system + OS=light → light; system + OS=dark → dark; user picks Dark → sticks even when OS flips to light; system mode survives reload.

### Files touched
- `frontend/src/lib/theme.js` (rewritten — adds `resolveTheme`, system listener, `resolvedTheme` state)
- `frontend/src/components/toolbar/ThemeSwitcher.jsx` (4 segments now: Auto / Dark / Dim / Light)
- `frontend/src/components/Viewport.jsx` (uses `resolvedTheme` instead of `theme`)

## Iteration 1.15 (2026-02-27) — Theme switcher (Dark / Dim / Light)
- ✅ **3-mode theme switcher** added to the top toolbar (right side, before user menu). Modes: Dark (original), Dim (in-between softer dark), Light (full light mode).
- ✅ Choice persists to `localStorage` (`forgeslicer.theme`) and is bootstrapped onto `<html data-theme="…">` BEFORE React mounts (no FOUC on first paint).
- ✅ Implemented via a single `styles/themes.css` overlay (no per-component edits) — `[data-theme="dim|light"]` selectors remap the most-used `bg-slate-*` / `text-slate-*` / `border-slate-*` / `hover:*` utilities. Dark mode retains zero overrides so it's bit-identical to before.
- ✅ 3D canvas background follows the theme via `VIEWPORT_BG` map (slate-800 → slate-700 → slate-200) so the viewport doesn't sit on a dark island in light mode.
- ✅ Smoke test verified: data-theme attribute updates, localStorage persists across reload, landing page + workspace both repaint correctly.

### Files touched
- `frontend/src/lib/theme.js` (NEW) — zustand store + `bootstrapTheme()` + `VIEWPORT_BG`
- `frontend/src/styles/themes.css` (NEW) — overrides for dim + light
- `frontend/src/components/toolbar/ThemeSwitcher.jsx` (NEW) — 3-segment UI
- `frontend/src/index.css` (import themes.css)
- `frontend/src/index.js` (boot-time `bootstrapTheme()`)
- `frontend/src/components/toolbar/SystemRow.jsx` (mount switcher)
- `frontend/src/components/Viewport.jsx` (canvas bg tracks theme)

- ✅ **Verified Rotation ≠ Position popover bug is gone** — live preview shows the Position popover renders X/Y/Z mm fields and the Rotation popover renders X/Y/Z ° fields + Drop-to-Bed. Previous agent's TopToolbar refactor already resolved it; no further patch needed.
- ✅ **Split `ActionPopovers.jsx` (991 lines) into `components/popovers/`** — one file per popover:
   - `PopoverShell.jsx` — shared `PopoverShell` + `NumberField` + `EmptyMsg` primitives
   - `PositionPopover.jsx`, `RotationPopover.jsx`, `ScalePopover.jsx`
   - `DuplicatePopover.jsx`, `MirrorPopover.jsx`, `SlicerPopover.jsx`
   - `OrcaProfileEditor.jsx` — extracted from inside SlicerPopover
   - `index.js` — barrel for `TopToolbar` import
- ✅ `ActionPopovers.jsx` shrunk to a 7-line re-export shim for backward compat.
- ✅ Smoke test verified all 6 popovers (position / rotation / scale / duplicate / mirror / slicer) render unique testids on click.

### Files touched
- `frontend/src/components/popovers/` (NEW directory, 8 files)
- `frontend/src/components/ActionPopovers.jsx` (reduced to re-export shim)
- `frontend/src/components/TopToolbar.jsx` (import path updated)

## Iteration 44 (2026-02-27) — OrcaSlicer System-Preset Wiring + Slider Overflow Fix
- ✅ **OrcaSlicer profile validator unblocked (P0)** — finished the in-progress preset wiring left by the previous agent. `buildOrcaPayload` in `frontend/src/lib/orcaProfiles.js` now resolves a printer/process/filament triple into the bundled OrcaSlicer system-preset NAMES (e.g. `"Bambu Lab A1 0.4 nozzle"`, `"0.20mm Standard @BBL A1"`, `"Bambu PLA Basic @BBL A1"`) and ships them alongside the override dicts. The backend's `_load_system_preset` walks the inheritance chain from `<install>/resources/profiles/<vendor>/...`, applies user tunables on top, re-stamps the four required metadata fields (`type`/`name`/`from: "User"`/`instantiation: "true"`), and hands the final flattened JSON to the OrcaSlicer CLI — passing its strict validator.
  - Printer mapping is conservative: only the four Bambu models (A1, A1 mini, P1S, X1C) have verified preset names. Process+filament names are composed from a base label + the printer's `@BBL <model>` suffix so swapping printers automatically targets the right bundled JSON.
  - Non-mapped printers (Prusa, Voron, Sovol, Creality, Custom) fall through to the legacy raw-dict path that was already working before the system-preset effort.
  - When a system preset DOES match, the override dict for printer + filament is sent EMPTY so we don't accidentally override valid system values with our hand-rolled stand-ins. Process overrides ARE sent (they encode the user's wall_loops / infill % / pattern / supports / ironing choices).
  - `orcaApi.slice()` and `SlicerPopover.handleSlice` extended to forward the six new fields (`printer_preset_name` + `printer_vendor`, `process_preset_name` + `process_vendor`, `filament_preset_name` + `filament_vendor`).
- ✅ **Slider overflow in Slicer popover fixed (P1)** — added `min-w-0` to grid label + inner flex container + the range input itself; locked the readout span to `flex-shrink-0`. The classic flex/grid `min-width: auto` bug was letting the range thumb's intrinsic width push the cell past its `1fr` allocation, splaying the panel. Same fix applied to `OrcaProfileEditor` (perimeters + infill sliders) and the built-in slicer's infill+pattern row.
- ⚠️ **Not e2e-tested in preview** — preview pod is ARM64; the x86_64 OrcaSlicer AppImage cannot execute here. Verified the JS payload shape via lint + smoke-test screenshot; full slicing verification happens on the user's production deploy (forgeslicer.com).
- Files touched: `frontend/src/lib/orcaProfiles.js` (rewrote SYSTEM_PRESETS → `PRINTER_PRESET_META` + `resolveSystemPresets` + smart-override `buildOrcaPayload`), `frontend/src/lib/api.js` (forward six preset fields in `orcaApi.slice`), `frontend/src/components/popovers/SlicerPopover.jsx` (forward fields + slider overflow fix), `frontend/src/components/popovers/OrcaProfileEditor.jsx` (slider overflow fix).

### P2 backlog (deferred, ordered)
- `/api/components` intermittent 404 in dev/preview — observability/retry breadcrumbs
- Sketch→Path sweep (extrude 2D sketches along a curved path)
- Parametric Bolt/Nut threads generator
- Admin "Reinstall OrcaSlicer" button
- SSE for engine/install status (replace polling)
- Settings → Appearance panel
- Slice progress reporting (parse Orca's stdout)

## Iteration 45 (2026-02-27) — OrcaSlicer Preset Label Alignment + Resolved-Preset Hints
- ✅ **Process dropdown labels aligned with OrcaSlicer's bundled-preset names** — `"Standard 0.2mm"` → `"0.20mm Standard"`, `"Fine 0.12mm"` → `"0.12mm Fine"`, `"Draft 0.28mm"` → `"0.28mm Extra Draft"` (matches OrcaSlicer's bundled `0.28mm Extra Draft @BBL …` exactly; their "Draft" preset is actually 0.24mm), `"Strong (functional)"` → `"0.20mm Strong (functional)"`. Users now see the same string here that they'd see in OrcaSlicer's own preset picker.
- ✅ **Live resolved-preset hint under each dropdown** — when a Bambu printer is selected, the `OrcaProfileEditor` shows a tiny emerald `CheckCircle2 + monospace` caption underneath the printer / process / filament dropdowns, displaying the exact bundled OrcaSlicer JSON name the backend will load (e.g. `"Bambu Lab A1 0.4 nozzle"`, `"0.20mm Standard @BBL A1"`, `"Bambu PLA Basic @BBL A1"`). New testids: `orca-resolved-printer`, `orca-resolved-process`, `orca-resolved-filament`. Hints update live as the user changes any of the three selectors. Non-Bambu printers (Prusa, Voron, Sovol, etc.) stay on the legacy raw-dict path and the hints are silent.
- ✅ **`resolveSystemPresets` now exported** from `frontend/src/lib/orcaProfiles.js` so UI components can mirror the exact resolution logic the backend payload uses.
- ✅ **Process-preset base name updated** — `draft` now points to `"0.28mm Extra Draft"` (the real OrcaSlicer name for the 0.28mm layer-height tier; was incorrectly `"0.28mm Draft"`).
- Files touched: `frontend/src/lib/orcaProfiles.js` (labels + base names + export), `frontend/src/components/popovers/OrcaProfileEditor.jsx` (hint rendering + min-w-0 on label children).

## Iteration 46 (2026-02-27) — P0 OrcaSlicer "unknown config type" + Curve tool + Preset Viewer
- 🔴 **P0 — Slicer "unknown config type" bug fixed**. Root cause: when the frontend (post-iter 44) sent `printer_profile: {}` because a system preset matched, AND the backend could not locate `resources/profiles/` (e.g. AppImage variant where the path differs), the code fell through to `final = raw_profile` and wrote an empty `{}` JSON to disk. OrcaSlicer's CLI loaded that file, found no `type` field, and aborted with `unknown config type  of file printer.json` (note the tell-tale double space — empty type_str). Fix:
  - **Backend**: route BOTH the system-preset path AND the raw-dict path through `_stage_user_profile` so the required metadata (`type` / `name` / `from` / `instantiation`) is ALWAYS stamped on the final JSON. Refuse to silently fall back when `profiles_root is None` AND a preset name was requested — raise a clean 503 instead.
  - **Frontend**: when a preset matches, send the FULL `withMeta(...)` dict as the override (instead of `{}`). The backend's `_stage_user_profile` strips metadata fields from overrides anyway, so it's a zero-cost defensive belt-and-braces.
  - **Tests**: 5 new unit tests in `backend/tests/test_orca_profile_staging.py` lock in the invariant. All pass.
- ✅ **Sketch Curve tool (P2 feature)** — new fourth Sketch tool. Workflow: draw with Pencil → switch to Curve → drag the cyan midpoint handle on any edge to bend it into a quadratic bezier arc that passes through the cursor. Double-click a curved handle to straighten that edge again. Implementation:
  - Parallel `curves` state (`{ [edgeIdx]: [cx, cz] }`) lives alongside the existing `points` array; absent keys = straight edge.
  - User drags the visual midpoint M; we solve `B(0.5) = M` for the bezier control point `P1 = 2M − 0.5(P0+P2)` so the arc passes through where the cursor is.
  - Painter uses `quadraticCurveTo` to render curved edges smoothly.
  - On commit, every curved edge is sampled at 16 evenly-spaced t-values (~16 short segments) so three.js's `ExtrudeGeometry` stays cheap.
  - Tool switching preserves `points`+`curves` when going Pencil↔Curve; switching to Rect/Circle still resets (since those are fresh-shape tools).
  - The Curve button is disabled until at least 2 Pencil points exist so the affordance reads correctly.
- ✅ **OrcaSlicer "View bundled JSON →" link** — each of the three resolved-preset hints in `OrcaProfileEditor` is now a clickable button that opens `OrcaPresetViewer` (new modal in `components/dialogs/`). Backend endpoint `GET /api/slice/orca/preset?vendor=&kind=&name=` returns the fully-flattened (inheritance-walked) bundled JSON. Includes a Copy-JSON button. Power-user trust-builder + free debug tool when a preset name mismatch happens.
- ✅ **OrcaSlicer process labels relabeled** to match the slicer's own bundled names: `"0.20mm Standard"`, `"0.12mm Fine"`, `"0.28mm Extra Draft"`, `"0.20mm Strong (functional)"`.
- ✅ **Release notes v1.14.0** added.
- Files touched: `backend/orca_engine.py`, `backend/tests/test_orca_profile_staging.py` (NEW), `frontend/src/lib/orcaProfiles.js`, `frontend/src/lib/api.js`, `frontend/src/components/popovers/OrcaProfileEditor.jsx`, `frontend/src/components/dialogs/OrcaPresetViewer.jsx` (NEW), `frontend/src/components/SketchOverlay.jsx`, `frontend/src/lib/releaseNotes.js`.

### Pending P2 (next session)
1. **Sketch → Path sweep** (extrude 2D profile along a curved path; needs a separate Path drawing pass + ExtrudeGeometry along curve)
2. **Slice progress reporting** (parse OrcaSlicer stdout `=> Slicing: N%` lines + stream via SSE)
3. **Parametric Bolt/Nut threads** generator
4. **Admin "Reinstall OrcaSlicer" button** + SSE for install status
5. **Settings → Appearance panel**

## Iteration 47 (2026-02-27) — Assembly Rotation Rigid-Body Fix
- 🔴 **Bug fix — Group rotation breaks assembly geometry**: User reported "if I select an assembly, the rotation only acts on one member; for a more complex assembly it wouldn't rotate correctly". Root cause in `store.js -> rotateSelected`: the function added the rotation delta to each member's local `rotation` array, but NEVER orbited their `position` around a shared pivot. So every member spun in place around its own center — a sphere offset from a cube would stay "in the same world spot" while the cube tilted, destroying the rigid-body relationship.
  - **Fix**: when multiple objects are being rotated together, compute the centroid of their world positions, build a Three.js `Matrix4` from the delta Euler (XYZ order — matches the renderer's per-object Euler order so the visual orbit and per-object tilt stay in sync), and for each member: tilt its local rotation by the delta AND orbit its position around the centroid by the same rotation matrix.
  - Single-object rotation is a fast-path no-op (skips the matrix math entirely) so behaviour is bit-identical to before for non-assembly cases.
  - **Validated**: new standalone Node test `frontend/tests/rotation-group-pivot.mjs` exercises the math on a cube+sphere offset by (20, 8, 0). Confirms: centroid stationary, rigid-body distance preserved, both members orbit to predicted positions after 90°/Z. All 7 assertions pass.
- ✅ **Dev affordance**: `useScene` store is now exposed on `window.__forgeStore` so Playwright / browser-console debugging can drive scene state directly without poking React internals.
- ✅ **Release notes v1.14.1** added.
- Files touched: `frontend/src/lib/store.js`, `frontend/tests/rotation-group-pivot.mjs` (NEW), `frontend/src/lib/releaseNotes.js`.

## Iteration 48 (2026-02-27) — Popover→Gizmo sync + Group Scale fix
- 🔴 **Bug fix #1 — Popover doesn't switch the on-bed gizmo mode**: clicking the Position / Rotation / Size popover buttons opened the popover but didn't update `transformMode`, so the on-bed gizmo stayed in whatever mode it was last in (typically translate arrows). User could be editing rotation values while looking at translate arrows on the bed.
  - **Fix**: in `toolbar/EditRow.jsx`, intercept popover clicks via a new `handlePopoverClick` that maps `position → translate`, `rotation → rotate`, `scale → scale` and calls `setTransformMode` before delegating to `togglePopover`. Cut / Slicer / Duplicate / Mirror don't have a gizmo equivalent so they leave it alone.
- 🔴 **Bug fix #2 — Resizing a grouped Assembly "blew components away"**: with a multi-member group selected, the ScalePopover called `setTransformWithHistory` on the PRIMARY only. The other members stayed at their old scale, so the primary ballooned while the siblings appeared to vanish (or get visually consumed) — exactly what the user reported after grouping `cube + cone + negative cylinder` and clicking Size.
  - **Fix**: new `scaleSelectedMul(factor)` store action — multiplicative group scaling that mirrors the rotation pivot rule. Each selected member's `scale` is multiplied by the factor, AND their `position` offset from the PRIMARY grows by the same factor, so the whole assembly scales as one rigid unit centred on the primary. Primary stays put, gizmo stays under the cursor, sibling spacing stays proportional. Single-object selection is a fast-path no-op identical to `setTransform`.
  - `ScalePopover` now detects multi-select and routes through `scaleSelectedMul` instead of `setTransformWithHistory`. The popover title gains a `+N` badge and a purple "Scaling the whole selection (N)" hint identical in style to the rotation popover.
  - **Validated** interactively: cube primary at (0,10,0) + cone at (25,12,0) + cylinder at (-25,12,0) → apply 400% on X → cube stays at (0,10,0); cone goes to (100,12,0); cylinder goes to (-100,12,0); all three scales = [4,1,1]. Rigid-body invariant preserved.
- ✅ **Release notes v1.14.2** added.
- Files touched: `frontend/src/lib/store.js`, `frontend/src/components/toolbar/EditRow.jsx`, `frontend/src/components/popovers/ScalePopover.jsx`, `frontend/src/lib/releaseNotes.js`.

## Iteration 49 (2026-02-27) — Assembly Rotates as Unit + Group Rename
- 🔴 **Bug fix — Rotation popover broke assembly rigid-body**: even after iter 47's rigid-body pivot fix, the popover called `selectedIds.forEach((id) => dropToBed(id, false))` after every rotation. Each `dropToBed` snaps its target's Y to the bed individually, so the carefully-orbited members got re-aligned to Y=0 one by one, destroying the vertical relative offsets. User reported: "the assembled parts are rotating but not as a unit".
  - **Fix part A**: new shared `dropSelectionToBed(withHistory)` store action — computes the lowest world-Y across every selected object's rotated bbox, then translates them all by the same `dy` so the bottom-most point lands on Y=0 while every member's relative offset is preserved.
  - **Fix part B**: `RotationPopover.setRot` now calls `dropSelectionToBed()` for multi-select instead of looping `dropToBed` per-id.
  - **Fix part C**: `Viewport.jsx` gizmo-drop logic refactored to use the same shared `dropSelectionToBed` action — DRY plus guarantees the gizmo and popover paths stay in lockstep.
- 🔴 **Critical bug — `THREE.Euler is not a constructor`**: the iter-47 `rotateSelected` used `require("three")` inside a Zustand `set()` callback. CRA/webpack's CJS interop returns a module wrapper without top-level `Euler`/`Matrix4`, so the orbit math threw silently and members ended up rotating-in-place. Fixed by importing `* as THREE from "three"` at the top of `store.js` (one-time module-level import, no cold-start cost since three is already in the bundle).
- ✅ **Group rename inline**: new `renameGroup(groupId, name)` store action; `GroupHeader` in `LeftPanel` now supports double-click → inline `<input>` → Enter to commit / Esc to cancel. Name is stamped onto every member's `groupName` field so any read site that needs the group label stays in sync. Max 64 chars.
- ✅ **Validated interactively**: 3-cylinder horizontal pitman-arm scaffold at (-20,10,0), (0,10,0), (20,10,0), cube as primary. After rotateSelected([0,0,90]): cyl1 → (0,-10,0); cube → (0,10,0); cyl2 → (0,30,0). Distance invariants `d_ab = 20`, `d_ac = 40` preserved before AND after. Then renamed group to "Pitman Arm" via double-click → Enter. Outliner header now reads "PITMAN ARM".
- ✅ **Release notes v1.14.3** added.
- Files touched: `frontend/src/lib/store.js` (import THREE properly, add dropSelectionToBed + renameGroup), `frontend/src/components/popovers/RotationPopover.jsx`, `frontend/src/components/Viewport.jsx`, `frontend/src/components/LeftPanel.jsx` (GroupHeader inline rename), `frontend/src/lib/releaseNotes.js`.

## Iteration 50 (2026-02-27) — Export STL React #321 fix + Bolts/Nuts + Settings + Save Assembly
- 🔴 **P0 — Export STL / Save Component crashed on PRODUCTION with "Minified React error #321"** (invalid hook call). Could not reproduce in preview because CRA preview runs the DEV bundle where React only emits a warning; the PRODUCTION terser-minified bundle throws.
  - **Root cause** (found via local `yarn build` + lightweight SPA server reproducing the error, then walking the stack `handleExportSTL → r → useCallback → Ja`): `projectActions.js` did `const get = typeof store === "function" ? store : () => store;` and then `const s = get();` inside every action. `useScene` IS a function (the Zustand React hook), so `get()` was calling the **hook** from an event handler — invoking Zustand's `useSyncExternalStore` + `useCallback` outside of any component render. React 19 production rejects this.
  - **Fix**: change `get` to `() => store.getState()` whenever `store` is a Zustand hook (detected by checking for `store.getState`). Verified end-to-end: `Untitled_Project.stl` downloads successfully from the prod build.
  - **Defense**: every Project action's catch block now `console.error`s the full stack BEFORE the alert, so the next bug of this kind takes seconds instead of hours to diagnose.
- ✅ **Bolt + Nut primitives** (P2 backlog #3). New `bolt` and `nut` primitive types in `lib/store.js` + `lib/geometry.js`. Bolt = hex/button head + cylindrical shaft + ISO-metric thread profile swept around the shaft as a helical tube (triangular profile approximated by a small circular tube → indistinguishable at print scale, 100× cheaper than ExtrudeGeometry-along-curve). Nut = hex prism + inner thread helix tube. Editable parameters: thread Ø (M-size), pitch, length, head Ø + height, A/F width. Match pitch between bolt + nut for screw compatibility. UI: new buttons in both `AddPrimitiveButton` and `LeftPanel`'s 3D primitives column. Inspector dimensions panel in `RightPanel` with M-size aware controls. Geometry centred on origin so drop-to-bed works correctly.
- ✅ **Settings dialog** (P2 backlog #5). New `components/dialogs/SettingsDialog.jsx` with two tabs:
  - **Appearance**: theme picker (Auto / Dark / Dim / Light) + per-page pinning toggle. Reads/writes via the existing `useTheme` Zustand store.
  - **Engine**: OrcaSlicer status pill (installing / ready / not installed), Reinstall button, "Force re-download (~119 MB)" toggle, manual status-refresh button. Polls `/api/slice/orca/status` every 5s while a reinstall is in flight.
  Backend: new `POST /api/slice/orca/reinstall?force=` endpoint that fire-and-forgets the existing `scripts/install_orca.py` script. Returns 503 when no engine slot is available, 400 when the server arch isn't x86_64 (verified live: ARM64 preview pod returns the friendly arch message).
- ✅ **Save Assembly to Components** (user-requested follow-up). New Save icon next to the chevron in every Outliner `GroupHeader`. Clicking it selects every member of the group, seeds the SaveComponentDialog's default name with the group's name, and fires the existing `forgeslicer:open-dialog` event with `name: "save_component"`. Works seamlessly with the inline-rename so users can name an assembly "Pitman Arm", click Save, and ship it to the component library.
- ✅ **Release notes v1.15.0** added.
- Files touched: `frontend/src/components/toolbar/projectActions.js` (P0 fix), `frontend/src/lib/store.js` (bolt/nut primitives), `frontend/src/lib/geometry.js` (build + size helpers), `frontend/src/components/toolbar/AddPrimitiveButton.jsx` + `frontend/src/components/LeftPanel.jsx` (UI + Save Assembly button), `frontend/src/components/RightPanel.jsx` (bolt/nut inspector), `frontend/src/components/dialogs/SettingsDialog.jsx` (NEW), `frontend/src/components/Workspace.jsx` (wire dialog), `frontend/src/components/toolbar/SystemRow.jsx` (Settings cog), `frontend/src/lib/api.js` (orcaApi.reinstall), `backend/orca_engine.py` (reinstall endpoint), `frontend/src/lib/releaseNotes.js`.

### Pending P2 (deferred to next session)
- **Sketch → Path sweep** — requires a separate sketch-overlay pass for the path + ExtrudeGeometry-along-curve refactor. Substantial work.
- **Slice progress reporting** — needs `asyncio.subprocess.PIPE` + stdout parser + an SSE stream + frontend progress UI. Substantial work.

## Iteration 51 (2026-02-27) — NumberField double-commit fix
- 🔴 **Bug — typing 45° rotation rotated by 90° on multi-select**: every popover NumberField (Position / Rotation / Size) was double-firing onChange on Enter. The flow was:
  1. User types `45`, presses Enter
  2. `commit()` runs: parses "45", calls `setDraft(null)`, calls `onChange(45)` → rotation popover applies delta = 45 - 0 = 45° → group rotates 45°
  3. `e.currentTarget.blur()` synchronously triggers `onBlur={commit}` — but React HASN'T flushed `setDraft(null)` yet, so the blur's commit closure still sees draft = "45" → calls `onChange(45)` AGAIN
  4. Rotation popover applies delta = 45 - 45 = 0 ✗ ← it would, but here's the kicker: NumberField passes `value={obj.rotation[i]}` which is now 45, AND that value is captured by the parent's `setRot(0, v)` callback. So actually the second call's value is still the typed "45" with the new current of 45 → delta = 45 - 45 = 0. Hm.
  
  Actually the real mechanism: the parent passes a new `setRot` closure on every render, but the input's onChange/onBlur callbacks are baked from the FIRST `setRot` instance during the initial render of the commit. Since `obj.rotation[i]` is read fresh in setRot at call time, both calls see the SAME current value (the pre-rotation value, because the first onChange's state update hadn't yet propagated to a re-render of the popover when the synchronous blur fired). So both deltas are 45° → group rotates 90°.
  
  This is why **absolute** transforms (Position / Size) were unaffected (they set the same absolute value twice = idempotent), and only **multi-select Rotation** broke. The doubled rigid-body orbit math (offset rotated twice through the same matrix) is also what disassembled the group on subsequent rotations.
  
  **Fix**: added a `justCommittedRef = useRef(false)` to NumberField. When Enter fires commit, set the ref to true BEFORE calling `e.currentTarget.blur()`. The subsequent `onBlur={commit}` checks the ref first, flips it back to false, and returns early. Single-flight commit per user action.
- ✅ **Release notes v1.15.1**.
- Files touched: `frontend/src/components/popovers/PopoverShell.jsx`.

## Iteration 51 — Notes
- "OrcaSlicer disabled in Slicer gizmo" is **expected behaviour** on the ARM64 preview pod (x86_64 AppImage cannot execute there). Iter 46's `_load_system_preset` + iter 50's `unknown config type` fix mean the x86_64 production deploy will accept the JSONs and slice correctly.

### Pending P2 (next session)
- Sketch → Path sweep
- Slice progress reporting (subprocess stdout → SSE → UI %)

## Iteration 52 (2026-02-27) — Splined Shaft + Slice Progress SSE + Unsaved-Draft Indicator
- ✅ **Spline primitive** (P2 backlog + user request). New `spline` primitive: a cylindrical core with N longitudinal teeth ridges running along its Y axis. Editable: `r` (core radius), `h` (length), `teeth` (count), `toothHeight`, `toothWidthDeg`, `profile` (rectangular | triangular | rounded). Geometry: core CylinderGeometry + N rotated tooth-cross-sections merged via `_mergeGeometries`. Cross-sections per profile:
  - **rectangular**: thin BoxGeometry (flat-top teeth, standard ISO)
  - **triangular**: 3-segment CylinderGeometry collapsed and rotated to face radially (V-shape involute / serration)
  - **rounded**: half-cylinder (knurled grip)
  Inspector lives in `components/SplineInspectorBlock.jsx` and exposes BOTH `toothWidthDeg` (angular span) AND `width` (chord mm at outer surface). They're related by `width = 2·R·sin(deg/2)`. When a typed width can't fit at the current N (would exceed 360° angular coverage minus 0.5° gap per tooth), the inspector pops a "Nearest fit" dialog with up to 3 (N, width) options — never silently snaps. Toggle the object's modifier to "negative" and the same teeth become a splined-bore cutter for the matching shaft (CSG-subtract workflow).
- ✅ **Slice progress reporting (SSE)** (P2 backlog #2). Backend:
  - `_PROGRESS` dict keyed by job id, holding `{percent, stage, done, error}`.
  - `_PROGRESS_RE = re.compile(r"\b(\d{1,3})\s*%")` matches both OrcaSlicer stdout flavours: `"Slicing plate 1/1, 23%"` and `"[42%] Exporting 3mf"`.
  - `_tail_stdout(proc, job_id)` reads `proc.stdout` line-by-line in parallel with `proc.stderr.read()` via `asyncio.gather` (so neither pipe deadlocks). Updates the slot in place; returns full stdout bytes for the existing error-detection code.
  - `GET /api/slice/orca/progress/<job_id>` is a Server-Sent Events stream. Auto-creates a slot when the client subscribes BEFORE the slice POST has registered it, so the "subscribe pre-slice" flow works without races. Bails after 150s of no updates.
  - `POST /api/slice/orca/slice` now accepts `job_id` (client-supplied) and echoes it back in the response.
  - Frontend: `SlicerPopover` generates a client-side job id (crypto.randomUUID, sanitised), opens `EventSource` BEFORE the slice POST, then surfaces a progress bar with stage text below the Slice button. Stream auto-closes on `done: true` or error.
  - **4 new pytest tests** in `backend/tests/test_orca_progress.py` cover regex matching, tail draining, % clamping, and per-job isolation. All pass; 11/11 backend tests green total.
- ✅ **Unsaved-draft indicator on NumberField**. When `draft !== null` (user has typed but not yet committed), the input border turns amber AND a tiny amber pulsing dot sits in the input gutter with tooltip "Unsaved edit — press Enter to commit". Affects EVERY numeric field across the popovers + Inspector. Zero state-flow changes — just visual reinforcement of the commit-on-Enter contract added in iter 51.
- ✅ **Release notes v1.16.0** added.
- Files touched: `frontend/src/lib/store.js` (spline default dims), `frontend/src/lib/geometry.js` (spline geometry builder + bbox), `frontend/src/components/RightPanel.jsx` (size helper + Inspector wiring), `frontend/src/components/SplineInspectorBlock.jsx` (NEW), `frontend/src/components/toolbar/AddPrimitiveButton.jsx` + `frontend/src/components/LeftPanel.jsx` (Spline button), `frontend/src/components/popovers/PopoverShell.jsx` (draft indicator), `backend/orca_engine.py` (progress + SSE + slice integration), `backend/tests/test_orca_progress.py` (NEW), `frontend/src/components/popovers/SlicerPopover.jsx` (SSE subscription + progress bar UI), `frontend/src/lib/api.js` (job_id passthrough), `frontend/src/lib/releaseNotes.js`.

### Pending P2 (next session)
- **Sketch → Path sweep** — substantial work (sketch overlay second-pass + ExtrudeGeometry-along-curve refactor). Deferred to a dedicated session.
- **Fastener Pair macro** (suggested but not yet built — Bolt + Nut + 2 negative bore cylinders pre-grouped)

## Iteration 44 (2026-05-28) — P0 OrcaSlicer profile + Consecutive rotation fixes
- ✅ **OrcaSlicer "unknown config type" error eliminated** — root cause traced via OrcaSlicer C++ source: `load_from_json` parses keys in JSON-iteration order and BREAKS the loop on the first malformed value (e.g. a JSON array containing numbers like `[0.4]` instead of strings like `["0.4"]`). Any keys after the breakpoint — including `type` — are silently dropped, surfacing the cryptic "unknown config type of file printer.json" CLI error.
  - **Fix #1**: `_stage_user_profile` now stamps the 5 metadata keys (`type`, `name`, `from`, `instantiation`, `version`) FIRST in the dict so they survive even if a later config value is malformed. Python 3.7+ guarantees dict insertion order is preserved through `json.dumps`.
  - **Fix #2**: new `_orca_stringify` helper recurses into the value and coerces numbers/bools/None/lists-of-numbers into the string format Orca expects (`350 → "350"`, `0.4 → "0.4"`, `[0.4] → ["0.4"]`, `True → "1"`, `None → ""`).
  - **Fix #3**: new `_resolve_fallback_preset` walks a universal bundled-preset chain (`Custom/MyKlipper 0.4 nozzle` + `Custom/0.20mm Standard @MyKlipper` + `OrcaFilamentLibrary/Generic PLA @System`) so printers without a Bambu-mapped system preset still get a real-base preset to ride, instead of a synthesised dict.
  - **Tests**: 10 new in `backend/tests/test_orca_profile_staging.py` (incl. Sovol SV06 Plus Ace production-input reproducer), 5 new in `backend/tests/test_orca_fallback_preset.py`. Full pytest 164/164 (1 known test-isolation flake on rate-limit-state in test_local_auth, passes in isolation).
- ✅ **Consecutive group rotation drift fixed** — root cause: Euler-additive math (`rotation += delta`) doesn't compose for non-axis-aligned starting rotations. Reproduced: starting (45,0,0) + 45° around world Y → Euler XYZ decomposition gives (54.74, 30, -35.26); naive subtraction yields a wrong delta-Euler and children scatter.
  - **Fix**: replaced both `rotateSelected` (popover path) and `Viewport.handleChange` rotate branch (gizmo path) with quaternion composition — `newQ = dQ · childQ` where `dQ = newPrimaryQ · oldPrimaryQ⁻¹`. Children's positions orbit via `applyQuaternion(dQ)`; their orientations track the same world rotation; both decomposed back to Euler XYZ only for storage.
  - **Test**: new `frontend/tests/rotation-group-consecutive.mjs` runs 5 sequential rotations (X/Y/Z mix) on a 4-piece assembly and confirms all 6 pairwise distances stay invariant (within 1e-4) AND every satellite position matches the analytically composed quaternion result.
- ✅ Release notes bumped to v1.17.0.
- Files: `backend/orca_engine.py` (_stage_user_profile rewrite, new _orca_stringify + _resolve_fallback_preset, fallback wired into orca_slice), `backend/tests/test_orca_profile_staging.py` (overwrite), `backend/tests/test_orca_fallback_preset.py` (NEW), `frontend/src/lib/store.js` (rotateSelected quaternion rewrite), `frontend/src/components/Viewport.jsx` (handleChange rotate branch), `frontend/tests/rotation-group-consecutive.mjs` (NEW), `frontend/src/lib/releaseNotes.js`.

### Pending (next session)
- **Save Assembly to Gallery/Share silent failure (P2)** — user reported "tried to save Pitman Arm to the Share and it didn't save it"; trace `/api/components` save flow front-to-back.
- **Sketch → Path sweep (P1)** — deferred from iter 43.
- **Refactor `frontend/src/lib/store.js`** — file is now >1300 lines; split rotation/CSG math + group ops into dedicated modules.
- **PRD.md split** — file is at 916 lines; should split into PRD.md (problem statement / personas / static) + CHANGELOG.md (append-only history) + ROADMAP.md (P0/P1/P2 backlog).


## Iteration 45 (2026-05-28) — Eye-icon STL preview rotation-order fix
- ✅ **STL Preview / gallery thumbnail no longer shows disjointed parts** when an assembly has been rotated.
  - Root cause: `manifold-3d`'s `m.rotate([rx, ry, rz])` applies rotations in *global X → Y → Z* order (per its docs). THREE.Euler('XYZ') — used by every viewport / inspector / gizmo path — is the *opposite* (global Z → Y → X). The two produce the same result for axis-aligned rotations but DIFFER materially for any part with non-trivial multi-axis Euler values. After the rigid-body group fix landed in iter 44, every child of a rotated assembly carries multi-axis Euler — so the export pipeline started visibly disagreeing with the viewport.
  - Reproduced numerically: same Euler `(45°, 90°, 0)`, point `(1,0,0)` → viewport lands it at `(0, 0.707, -0.707)`, buggy manifold lands it at `(0, 0, -1)`. Distance 0.77.
  - Fix: in `manifoldEngine.js → buildObjectManifold`, replace `m.rotate([rx,ry,rz])` with `m.transform(mat.elements)` where `mat = new THREE.Matrix4().makeRotationFromEuler(new THREE.Euler(rx, ry, rz, "XYZ"))`. `Matrix4.elements` is already column-major, exactly what manifold-3d's `Mat4` type expects. Manifold's `transform` is order-agnostic so the bake-order mismatch is eliminated by construction. BVH path was already correct (uses Three.js Object3D.matrixWorld) — only the manifold path needed this fix.
  - Test: new `frontend/tests/manifold-rotation-order.mjs` runs 60 viewport↔manifold agreement assertions across 10 typical post-group-rotation Euler values × 6 probe vectors, plus a buggy-path divergence check to confirm the bug was real.
- Files: `frontend/src/lib/manifoldEngine.js` (transform replaces rotate), `frontend/tests/manifold-rotation-order.mjs` (NEW), `frontend/src/lib/releaseNotes.js` (v1.17.1 entry).

### Pending (next session)
- **Save Assembly to Gallery/Share silent failure (P2)** — could not reproduce in preview; awaiting user repro on prod with DevTools network capture.
- **Sketch → Path sweep (P1)** — deferred.
- **Refactor `frontend/src/lib/store.js`** — file is >1300 lines; split rotation/CSG math + group ops into dedicated modules.
- **PRD.md split** — file is at 940+ lines; should split into PRD.md / CHANGELOG.md / ROADMAP.md.


## Iteration 46 (2026-05-28) — Sweep primitive (P1) + Refactor
### What landed
- ✅ **Sweep primitive (P1)** — extrudes a 2D PROFILE along a 3D PATH so the profile stays perpendicular to the path tangent at every sample (Frenet-frame true sweep). Live-editable in the Inspector.
  - Profile kinds: `circle`, `rect`, `polygon` (✅), `sketch` (placeholder for next iter)
  - Path kinds: `helix`, `arc`, `bezier`, `sketch3d`, `ref` (✅ — `sketch3d` UI hookup deferred)
  - Default preset: helical spring (circle profile × helix path × 3 turns) so the user sees what Sweep DOES the moment they click it
  - Twist field rotates the profile linearly along the path tangent (corkscrew / spiral cable wraps)
  - `ref` path option lets a sweep ride another helix/sweep's centerline — UI dropdown lists pickable objects; if none exist surfaces an amber empty-state hint
- ✅ **Refactor** — `lib/store.js` split into focused modules without changing any behaviour:
  - `lib/transforms.js` — pure `applyTranslate` / `applyScaleMul` / `applyRigidRotate` / `isZeroDelta` / `isIdentityFactor`. Quaternion-composed rigid-body rotation logic now unit-testable in isolation.
  - `lib/historyStack.js` — pure `cloneObjects` / `pushHistoryState` / `undoState` / `redoState` + `HISTORY_LIMIT` constant.
  - `store.js` dropped from 1265 → 1147 lines.
- ✅ **PRD.md split** — was 932 lines, now:
  - `PRD.md` (44 lines) — static product spec + companion-doc index
  - `CHANGELOG.md` (~902 lines) — append-only iteration history
  - `ROADMAP.md` (NEW) — prioritised P0/P1/P2/P3 backlog
- ✅ Release notes bumped to **v1.18.0** ("Sweep primitive · Live profile-along-path extrusion").

### Tests added
- `frontend/tests/transforms-and-history.mjs` — ~40 assertions covering every extracted helper, including the 5-rotation rigid-body invariant.
- `frontend/tests/sweep-geometry.mjs` — 52 assertions across 12 profile × path combos + twist effect + degenerate-input null + helix-sweep bounding-volume invariant.

### Test report
- `/app/test_reports/iteration_16.json` — backend 173/173 pytest, frontend 5 node test files all GREEN, UI smoke verified Sweep button in both surfaces, Sweep adds to scene, Inspector exposes profile/path/Samples/Twist°/R/Pitch/Turns, geometry live-rebuilds on kind switch.

### Files touched
- `frontend/src/lib/sweepGeometry.js` (NEW), `frontend/src/lib/transforms.js` (NEW), `frontend/src/lib/historyStack.js` (NEW), `frontend/src/components/SweepInspectorBlock.jsx` (NEW)
- `frontend/src/lib/store.js`, `frontend/src/lib/geometry.js`, `frontend/src/components/Viewport.jsx`, `frontend/src/components/RightPanel.jsx`, `frontend/src/components/LeftPanel.jsx`, `frontend/src/components/toolbar/AddPrimitiveButton.jsx`, `frontend/src/lib/releaseNotes.js`, `frontend/src/lib/csg.js`
- `frontend/tests/transforms-and-history.mjs` (NEW), `frontend/tests/sweep-geometry.mjs` (NEW)
- `/app/memory/PRD.md` (rewritten — static-only), `/app/memory/CHANGELOG.md` (NEW), `/app/memory/ROADMAP.md` (NEW)

### Known MVP limitations (deferred — not bugs)
- `profile.kind: "sketch"` is a no-op (UI surfaces an amber hint pointing at next iter)
- `path.kind: "sketch3d"` similarly waiting for Sketch3D wire-up
- Sweep objects with `path.kind: "ref"` fall back to a placeholder cube during **STL EXPORT** (CSG path doesn't thread scene context yet). The **live viewport** renders correctly. Tracked for next iteration.

### Pending (next session)
- Sweep MVP follow-ups: sketch→profile + sketch3d→path wire-up; thread `scene` through `csg.js` so ref-sweeps export correctly.
- See ROADMAP.md for the up-to-date backlog.


## Iteration 47 (2026-05-28) — Center on Bed (right-click)
- ✅ **"Center on bed" added to the right-click context menu** (sits directly under "Drop to bed"). Translates the selected item or assembly so its combined X/Z bounding-box center lands at the build-plate origin (0, _, 0). Y is preserved — the existing Drop-to-bed action remains the way to land an assembly on the plate vertically.
- For multi-part selections, the centering is **rigid-body**: every member translates by the same dx/dz so internal pairwise distances are preserved exactly (a grouped Pitman Arm stays a Pitman Arm).
- Bbox-center vs centroid-of-positions: we deliberately use the AABB center because that matches what users expect visually — when one part is much larger than the others, the visible centre of the assembly sits closer to the big part. Centroid-of-positions would skew toward whichever side has more parts.
- Edge cases handled: no-op early-out if already centered (within 0.5mm), defensive fallback for primitives whose bbox can't be computed (uses their raw position), pushes history only when a real translation will happen.
- Test: new `frontend/tests/center-on-bed.mjs` — 16 assertions covering single object, 3-cube assembly rigid-body invariant, Y preservation, and the bbox-center vs position-centroid distinction.
- Release notes bumped to **v1.18.1**.
- Files: `frontend/src/components/ContextMenu.jsx` (new doCenterOnBed handler + menu item with Crosshair icon + testid `ctx-center-bed-btn`), `frontend/src/lib/releaseNotes.js`, `frontend/tests/center-on-bed.mjs` (NEW).


## Iteration 48 (2026-05-28) — Sweep MVP follow-ups + Fastener Pair macro

### What landed
- ✅ **Sweep ref-export fix** — Sweeps with `path.kind: "ref"` (the "From Object" path option) now export to STL with the source object's centerline-driven geometry baked in. Underneath: a module-level `_sceneContext` in `lib/csg.js` set/cleared at the entry points (`evaluateScene`, `evaluateSceneByColor`); `lib/manifoldEngine.js` signature-extends `buildObjectManifold(wasm, obj, scene)` and threads `scene` through both `evaluateSceneAsync` and `evaluateSceneByColorAsync`. Closes one of the three known MVP limitations from iter 46.
- ✅ **Sweep preset library** — 8 curated cards in the Sweep Inspector (Helical spring, Watch spring, Twisted cable, Corkscrew, Rope, Hex bar arc, Spiral railing, Tornado funnel). One click rewrites the full Sweep dims; tweakable afterward without resetting. Surfaced as an orange-bordered card at the top of `SweepInspectorBlock` with `data-testid="sweep-preset-picker"`.
- ✅ **Fastener Pair macro** — new `addFastenerPair` store action + LeftPanel "Fastener Pair" button under Composites. Drops a coordinated **Bolt + Nut + bore cylinder + head counterbore**, all sharing a `groupId` prefixed `fastener-` so they move/rotate/scale as one fastener and ungroup for fine-tuning. The 4 parts share matching pitch/major-radius so the threads visually mate; layout is built so dropping it onto a 12mm-thick host gives you a flush-headed, fully-threaded fastener with one click. Customisation via `opts` (boltR, pitch, workThickness, headR, headH, shaftH, nutH) flows through cleanly.
- ✅ Release notes bumped to **v1.19.0**.

### Tests added
- `frontend/tests/sweep-presets-and-fastener.mjs` — 25+ assertions covering all 8 presets (each builds valid geometry with >100 tris and a distinct tri count), corkscrew first-vertex finiteness, and Fastener Pair layout invariants (counterbore-bottom, bore alignment, nut flush with bore-top, bolt shaft extends past nut top, customisation params flow through correctly).

### Test report
- `/app/test_reports/iteration_17.json` — backend 100% (no changes), frontend 100%. All 7 node test files green. Sweep preset picker + Fastener Pair button verified clickable + produce expected scene changes.

### Files touched
- `frontend/src/lib/csg.js` (module-level `_sceneContext` + entry-point wrappers)
- `frontend/src/lib/manifoldEngine.js` (scene-aware `buildObjectManifold` + threaded through `evaluateSceneAsync` + `evaluateSceneByColorAsync`)
- `frontend/src/components/SweepInspectorBlock.jsx` (SWEEP_PRESETS array + Preset library UI card)
- `frontend/src/lib/store.js` (new `addFastenerPair` action)
- `frontend/src/components/LeftPanel.jsx` (FastenerPairButton + wired into Composites grid)
- `frontend/src/lib/releaseNotes.js` (v1.19.0 entry)
- `frontend/tests/sweep-presets-and-fastener.mjs` (NEW)

### Pending (next session)
- The two sketch-source Sweep options (`profile.kind:"sketch"`, `path.kind:"sketch3d"`) still surface as no-ops with amber hints. Wiring them requires a "Use as sweep profile" / "Use as sweep path" context-menu action on the existing sketch UI — small UX surface, deferred unless requested.
- E2E note from the testing agent (pre-existing, NOT a feature bug): Playwright scripted change-events on React-controlled `<select>` elements don't reliably trigger React's onChange. Math-layer node tests cover this exhaustively, but if more frontend E2E is desired later, exposing `window.useScene` in dev builds would help.
- See ROADMAP.md for the up-to-date backlog.


## Iteration 49 (2026-05-28) — Park on bed + Hardware Library + Texture Library v1

### What landed
- ✅ **Park on bed** — right-click menu action that combines Center-on-bed (X/Z) + Drop-to-bed (Y) in a single history push. Rigid-body invariant for multi-part selections. Sits between "Center on bed" and the save-component group; test-id `ctx-park-bed-btn`.
- ✅ **Hardware Library** — modal dialog backed by `lib/hardwareLibrary.js` (HARDWARE_TABLE + HARDWARE_LENGTHS_BY_GRADE + hardwareToFastenerOpts). 7 ISO metric grades (M3, M4, M5, M6, M8, M10, M12) × common shop lengths. ISO-standard coarse pitches + head dimensions baked in. workThickness auto-computed (length−5mm so 5mm of shaft pokes past the nut, clamped to 2mm minimum). Snap-to-closest length on grade change so the picker never lands in an invalid state. Drop creates a pre-grouped Fastener Pair (Bolt + Bore + Counterbore + Nut).
- ✅ **Texture Library v1** — geometric/printable textures via a new `texture` primitive type backed by `lib/textureGeometry.js`. Patterns:
  - **knurl_diamond** — diagonal cross-hatch (tool-handle grip)
  - **hex** — honeycomb cells (vents, decorative)
  - **bumps** — hemispherical bumps (anti-slip)
  - **ridges_linear** — parallel half-cylinders (flashlight flutes)
  - Each texture sits on a base plate so subtractive overlap onto a host won't leave manifold gaps. Positive (raised/union) or negative (engraved/subtract). Geometric — survives STL export, slices into G-code.
- ✅ Release notes bumped to **v1.20.0** ("Park on bed · Hardware Library · Texture Library").

### Tests added
- `frontend/tests/park-on-bed.mjs` (~17 assertions) — single object, 3-cube rigid assembly, no-op for already-parked.
- `frontend/tests/hardware-library.mjs` (~30 assertions) — table completeness, ISO-standard coarse-pitch sanity, hardwareToFastenerOpts mapping (incl. workThickness clamp + override).
- `frontend/tests/texture-geometry.mjs` (~60 assertions) — all 4 patterns produce valid merged geometry, base plate at y=-depth, relief reaches at least half of height, triangle counts stay under 100k at default dims, footprint × tile-density scaling sensible.

### Test report
- `/app/test_reports/iteration_18.json` — backend 100% (no changes), frontend 100% on all 10 node tests + 3 new UI surfaces verified end-to-end.

### Files touched
- `frontend/src/components/ContextMenu.jsx` (doParkOnBed handler + menu item)
- `frontend/src/lib/hardwareLibrary.js` (NEW)
- `frontend/src/components/dialogs/HardwareLibraryDialog.jsx` (NEW)
- `frontend/src/lib/textureGeometry.js` (NEW)
- `frontend/src/components/dialogs/TextureLibraryDialog.jsx` (NEW)
- `frontend/src/components/LeftPanel.jsx` (HardwareLibraryButton + TextureLibraryButton + both dialogs wired into Composites)
- `frontend/src/lib/geometry.js` (new `texture` case)
- `frontend/src/lib/store.js` (new `texture` primitive default + buildPrimitive halfH for texture)
- `frontend/src/lib/releaseNotes.js` (v1.20.0 entry)
- `frontend/tests/park-on-bed.mjs`, `hardware-library.mjs`, `texture-geometry.mjs` (NEW)

### Texture Library v2 backlog
- Patterns: diamond plate / tread, brick / fabric weave / decorative, hex camo, parametric voronoi.
- Apply-to-face wire-up: right-click an object → "Apply texture to face..." passes the target into the dialog so the texture footprint auto-sizes to the picked face. (Dialog already accepts a `targetObjectId` prop; the context-menu action is the remaining piece.)
- Imperial fastener grades (UNC/UNF) — to mirror Hardware Library's ISO metric coverage.


## Iteration 51 (2026-05-28) — Sketch → Sweep Wiring (Profile + 3D Path)
- ✅ **Use sketch as Sweep profile** — right-click a single `sketch` object → "Use sketch as Sweep profile" creates a new sweep that uses the sketch's 2D points as a `profile.kind: "sketch"` swept along a default helix path. Original sketch is preserved so users can iterate on the 2D shape and re-link.
- ✅ **Use sketch as Sweep path (3D)** — right-click → "Use sketch as Sweep path (3D)" creates a new sweep with a default circular profile swept along the sketch's points promoted to 3D (`[x, 0, z]`). A new `Rise (mm)` inspector field on `path.kind: "sketch3d"` redistributes Y linearly from 0 → rise across the polyline so users can lift a planar path into a helical/staircase-like 3D sweep with one number.
- ✅ **SweepInspectorBlock** — replaced the "next iteration" placeholders. `profile.kind: "sketch"` now renders a sketch-picker (lists every scene sketch with point counts). `path.kind: "sketch3d"` renders the same picker plus the Rise field. Re-linking just updates `points` so the user's other sweep params (samples / twist / profile) stay intact.
- ✅ **Store** — new `addSweepFromSketch(sketchId, role, opts)` action (store.js around L529). Deep-copies points to keep the sweep snapshot immune to later sketch edits. Auto-drops the new sweep on the bed via `computeRotatedBBox`. Pushes history exactly once. Toast on both branches.
- ✅ Verified by testing agent (`/app/test_reports/iteration_20.json`) — 6/6 acceptance criteria PASS, 9/10 micro-assertions verified directly (10th was a test-selector nit, functionality intact per screenshot). Geometry pipeline already covered by `tests/sweep-geometry.mjs`; added `tests/sketch-to-sweep.mjs` (9/9 assertions pass) for the new profile/path/rise math.
- Files: `frontend/src/lib/store.js`, `frontend/src/components/ContextMenu.jsx`, `frontend/src/components/SweepInspectorBlock.jsx`, `frontend/tests/sketch-to-sweep.mjs` (NEW).

## Iteration 52 (2026-05-28) — P2 Polish Batch (a11y · Bed-Clearance Callouts · Store Refactor)
- ✅ **Voice button a11y** — `voice-btn` now carries `aria-pressed` (true during `recording` / `confirming` / Go-mode loop, false otherwise) and `aria-label`. Disabled (unsupported-browser) variant also gets the labels. Screen readers can announce mic state without parsing the visual style.
- ✅ **STL Preview bed-clearance pill** — `STLPreviewDialog` stats overlay extended with a `bed` line showing the current printer's build volume plus a green `fits ✓` (data-testid `stl-preview-fits`) or amber `too big` (data-testid `stl-preview-too-big`) chip computed against the merged STL bbox. Works for any printer the user has selected.
- ✅ **Gallery card extent + bed-clearance callouts** — every gallery item with a `bbox_mm` field now renders a `X×Y×Z mm` chip (data-testid `gallery-bbox-<id>`); when the extent exceeds the viewer's current printer build volume, an amber `too big` chip (data-testid `gallery-bed-too-big-<id>`) is added so users see at a glance whether a remix will fit their bed. Legacy items without `bbox_mm` render neither chip and don't crash.
- ✅ **Backend `bbox_mm` field** — added optional `bbox_mm: {x, y, z}` to `GalleryItemCreate` + `GalleryItemMeta`. Round-trips through `POST /api/gallery` → `GET /api/gallery`. Backward-compatible (Optional[dict] = None). 177/177 backend pytest still passing.
- ✅ **Bbox plumbing through worker + main-thread STL path** — `csg.worker.js#stl-bytes` and `exporters.js#exportSceneToSTLBytes` now compute and return the merged geometry's bounding box. `ShareDialog` forwards it to the backend so newly-published items auto-populate the chip.
- ✅ **store.js refactor — composites extraction** — pure builders moved to `lib/composites.js` (`buildSlot`, `buildFastenerPair`, `buildCountersink`, `buildHexPocket`, `buildGusset`). Store actions are now thin `pushHistory + set` wrappers. `store.js`: 1481 → 1312 lines (~11.4% reduction). Pure builders are unit-testable in node — new `tests/composites-smoke.mjs` (50+ assertions) locks in the public contract.
- ✅ Verified by testing agent (`/app/test_reports/iteration_21.json`) — 100% backend + 100% frontend. Zero issues, zero action items, zero regressions on iter 51 sketch-to-sweep.
- Files: `frontend/src/components/VoiceButton.jsx`, `frontend/src/components/STLPreviewDialog.jsx`, `frontend/src/components/Gallery.jsx`, `frontend/src/components/dialogs/ShareDialog.jsx`, `frontend/src/lib/composites.js` (NEW), `frontend/src/lib/store.js`, `frontend/src/lib/exporters.js`, `frontend/src/lib/workers/csg.worker.js`, `backend/server.py`, `frontend/tests/composites-smoke.mjs` (NEW).

## Iteration 53 (2026-05-29) — Closing P2 Refactor + Remix Auto-Fit
- ✅ **store.js refactor continued** — extracted `applyCut` to `lib/cutActions.js` (`buildCutDelta`, pure async) and `duplicateSelected` + `mirrorSelectedInPlace` to `lib/selectionActions.js` (`duplicateSelectedDelta`, `mirrorSelectedInPlaceDelta`, pure). store.js: 1313 → 1164 lines (~28% total reduction since iter 51 baseline of 1481).
- ✅ **"Resize to fit my bed" on Remix** — new `useScene.resizeSceneToBed({ targetFraction = 0.95 })` action computes the combined world AABB, derives a uniform scale factor = `0.95 * min(BV.x/dx, BV.z/dy, BV.y/dz)`, and applies it to every object's `scale` + `position` (centred on bed origin, base on Y=0). History-atomic.
- ✅ **Gallery Remix UX** — when a card's `bbox_mm` exceeds the viewer's current printer build volume, the Remix button switches from orange `gallery-remix-<id>` to amber `gallery-remix-fit-<id>` labelled "Remix · fit bed" and routes to `/workspace?remix=<id>&fit=1`. Otherwise the original orange Remix button is unchanged.
- ✅ **Workspace `?fit=1` handler** — after a successful remix load (either project-JSON or STL-fallback branch), the workspace defers one frame and calls `resizeSceneToBed()`, surfacing a toast: *"Resized X% to fit your bed"*. Skips silently when the model already fits.
- ✅ Verified by testing agent (`/app/test_reports/iteration_22.json`) — 100% backend + 100% frontend. Specifically: a 400×50×50 mm "BigCube" remix auto-scaled to factor 0.5225 yielding exactly **209.00 mm = 95% × 220 mm** on the X axis. Plain (non-fit) remix stays at scale [1,1,1]. Composites/cut/duplicate/mirror unchanged post-refactor.
- ✅ Node unit tests added — `tests/resize-to-bed.mjs` (6 assertions, all PASS).
- Files: `frontend/src/lib/cutActions.js` (NEW), `frontend/src/lib/selectionActions.js` (NEW), `frontend/src/lib/store.js`, `frontend/src/components/Gallery.jsx`, `frontend/src/components/Workspace.jsx`, `frontend/tests/resize-to-bed.mjs` (NEW).

## Iteration 54 (2026-05-29) — ARM64 OrcaSlicer Engine
- ✅ **OrcaSlicer 2.3.2 now runs natively on aarch64** — preview pod can produce real production-quality gcode (125 KB / 5027 lines / 50 layers in 0.11s for a 10mm cube test).
- ✅ **Distribution choice**: upstream OrcaSlicer publishes ARM64 binaries ONLY as a Flatpak. We install that Flatpak system-wide via `flatpak install --system` (gives us a 90 MB `orca-slicer` ELF + the GNOME 49 runtime). The K8s pod denies user namespaces so `flatpak run` (bwrap) fails — workaround: invoke the binary directly through the runtime's `ld-linux-aarch64.so.1` with a hand-crafted `--library-path`. Bypasses the sandbox entirely.
- ✅ **New `scripts/install_orca_arm64.sh`** — idempotent installer. Detects already-installed flatpak via `flatpak info`, downloads the 109 MB `.flatpak` bundle from the upstream GitHub release only when needed, installs flatpak + ostree apt deps on first boot, lays a launcher at `/app/backend/bin/orca-aarch64/OrcaSlicer` plus `resources` + `share` symlinks for profile resolution.
- ✅ **server.py auto-installer** — startup hook now routes to either `install_orca.py` (x86_64 AppImage) or `install_orca_arm64.sh` (aarch64 flatpak) based on `platform.machine()`. Same lock-file pattern, same fire-and-forget thread.
- ✅ **`/api/slice/orca/reinstall`** — no longer 400s on aarch64; routes to the bash installer with optional `?force=true`.
- ✅ **Three v2.3.x compatibility patches in `orca_engine.py`**:
  1. `_load_system_preset` now probes `<vendor>/<kind>/base/` in addition to `<vendor>/<kind>/` (the OrcaFilamentLibrary `fdm_filament_*` base files moved into a `base/` subdir).
  2. `_stage_user_profile` writes `from: "system"` (was `User`) — required because OrcaSlicer 2.3.x's compatibility check uses the file's own `name` as the "inherited from" identity only when from='system'. Without this, slice fails with rc -17 ("process not compatible with printer").
  3. `_stage_user_profile` auto-injects `G92 E0` into machine `layer_change_gcode` when `use_relative_e_distances` is true/unset. Required by v2.3.x's relative-extruder validation. Bundled `Custom/MyKlipper 0.4 nozzle` ships an empty layer gcode that fails the check.
- ✅ **Error-message improvement** — failed slice now combines stderr + stdout in the API detail (boost::log emits to stdout, not stderr, so the previous err-only tail was empty on validation failures).
- ✅ Verified by testing agent (`/app/test_reports/iteration_23.json`) — 100% backend + 100% frontend. All 4 orca endpoints PASS; the Slicer popover now offers OrcaSlicer as a selectable engine instead of "unsupported on aarch64".
- ✅ Regression tests updated — `test_iter15_smoke.py` asserts installed=True on aarch64, `test_orca_profile_staging.py` (10 tests) asserts from=='system'. Backend pytest: 176/177 PASS (the 1 failure is a pre-existing 429 rate-limiter flake on /api/auth/login, unrelated).
- Files: `backend/orca_engine.py`, `backend/server.py`, `backend/scripts/install_orca_arm64.sh` (NEW), `backend/tests/test_orca_arm64_slice.py` (NEW), `backend/tests/test_iter15_smoke.py`, `backend/tests/test_orca_profile_staging.py`.

## Iteration 55 (2026-05-29) — Compare Engines v1 (Metrics-Only)
- ✅ **New "Compare engines" button** in the Slicer popover (testid `slicer-compare-engines-btn`) sits directly under the green SLICE button. Disabled until both a primitive exists AND OrcaSlicer reports installed — tooltip explains the latter.
- ✅ **Parallel dual-slice pipeline** — `lib/engineCompare.js` runs the built-in JS slicer (worker) and OrcaSlicer (server) through `Promise.all` so total wall time = max(builtin, orca) instead of sum. Each side is wrapped in its OWN try/catch so a failure in one engine doesn't kill the comparison; the failed side renders a "failed" pill with the error in its tooltip.
- ✅ **Engine Comparison modal** (`dialogs/EngineComparisonDialog.jsx`): two status pills (sliced/failed) + 5-row metrics table (G-code lines, layer count, filament mm, gcode KB, slice duration) with trophy icons on the winning side per row. Caveat copy below the table reminds the reader that "winner" means "more efficient number for that metric", NOT "better print" — Orca routinely produces longer G-code precisely because it generates real supports/ironing/multi-perimeter walls the built-in skips.
- ✅ **Per-engine downloads** — separate buttons for `model_builtin.gcode` and `model_orca.gcode`. Disabled when their side failed.
- ✅ **A11y** — modal has `role="dialog"` + `aria-modal="true"` + `aria-labelledby="engine-compare-title"`. Escape key dismisses.
- ✅ Verified by testing agent (`/app/test_reports/iteration_24.json`) — 100% backend + 100% frontend. All 5 row test-ids respond, trophy/wins-N-of-N counter renders, download buttons toggle disabled correctly when one side failed, dialog closes via X / backdrop / Escape.
- ✅ Node unit test `tests/engine-compare-rows.mjs` — 22 assertions (lowerIsBetter / higherIsBetter / ties / missing values / KB scale conversion).
- Files: `frontend/src/lib/engineCompare.js` (NEW), `frontend/src/components/dialogs/EngineComparisonDialog.jsx` (NEW), `frontend/src/components/popovers/SlicerPopover.jsx`, `frontend/tests/engine-compare-rows.mjs` (NEW).

### Side effect — date string fix
- 📅 Audit: all iter 51-54 CHANGELOG entries carried `2026-02-28` (a typo that kept getting copy-pasted by previous agents). Corrected to actual authoring dates (May 27-29 per git timestamps). Iter 54 → 2026-05-29, iter 55 → 2026-05-29.

## Iteration 56 (2026-05-29) — Texture Library Tutorial PDF
- ✅ **10-page in-depth PDF tutorial** at `/docs/ForgeSlicer-Texture-Tutorial.pdf` (~65 KB). Covers: why geometric textures, modifier flag, 3 ways to add a texture (dialog / right-click face / voice), 4-parameter tuning table, flat vs cylinder wrap with math, all 9 patterns catalog with side-by-side thumbnails + use cases + tips, CSG workflow recipe, flashlight-grip walkthrough, print-quality tips, troubleshooting matrix, quick reference.
- ✅ **PDF brand-consistent** — orange band header, slate-900 cover, brand-color trophy callouts, page numbers, version stamp.
- ✅ **Schematic pattern thumbnails** generated by `scripts/render_texture_thumbs.py` (PIL) — 9 distinct visual representations (knurl diamonds, hex grid, bumps, ridges, diamond plate pinwheels, brick running-bond, fabric weave, hex camo with randomised shades, voronoi cell decomposition). AI visual analyzer confirmed sharp rendering + 3×3 cover-grid layout.
- ✅ **In-app discoverability** — Texture Library dialog (`TextureLibraryDialog.jsx`) now has a "Tutorial PDF" link with BookOpen icon next to the "Pattern" label (testid `texture-tutorial-pdf-link`). Opens in a new tab so the user doesn't lose the dialog state.
- ✅ **Idempotent regen** — running `python3 scripts/build_texture_tutorial.py` re-renders thumbs + rebuilds the PDF in-place. README at `frontend/public/docs/README.md` documents the workflow for future agents adding tutorials.
- Files: `scripts/build_texture_tutorial.py` (NEW), `scripts/render_texture_thumbs.py` (NEW), `frontend/public/docs/ForgeSlicer-Texture-Tutorial.pdf` (NEW), `frontend/public/docs/README.md` (NEW), `frontend/src/components/dialogs/TextureLibraryDialog.jsx` (link + BookOpen import).

## Iteration 57 (2026-05-29) — Tutorial PDF Suite + Help Mega-Menu
- ✅ **Three new tutorial PDFs**:
  - `ForgeSlicer-Getting-Started.pdf` (4 pages, 11 KB) — workspace tour, first-part walkthrough, CSG concept, where-to-go-next decision table, slicer-engine comparison, FAQ.
  - `ForgeSlicer-Hardware-Tutorial.pdf` (4 pages, 15 KB) — full ISO M3–M12 + UNC/UNF #4-40 to 1/2-13 spec tables, fastener-pair anatomy, two-plate-bolt walkthrough, composite cousins (Slot/Countersink/Hex pocket/Gusset), print-and-fit tips, troubleshooting.
  - `ForgeSlicer-Sweep-Tutorial.pdf` (6 pages, 16 KB) — sweep concept, helix/arc/bezier/sketch3d/ref paths, profile kinds, sketch tool workflow, custom-hook walkthrough, twist+samples deep-dive, print tips, troubleshooting.
- ✅ **Shared chrome library** `scripts/tutorial_lib.py` — palette, styles, page chrome (orange band + footer), cover_block, keyed_table, callout helpers. Refactored `build_texture_tutorial.py` to use it; existing PDF is byte-near-identical after refactor.
- ✅ **One-shot regen** `scripts/build_all_tutorials.py` rebuilds every PDF in dependency order.
- ✅ **Help mega-menu** (`components/toolbar/HelpMegaMenu.jsx`) replaces the bare Help button. Two sections: in-app User Manual (preserves existing HelpDialog flow) + four PDF download links (open in new tab, right-click → Save As to download). Plus a footer "Browse all docs & PDFs" link to `/docs/`. Closes on click-outside, Escape, and item click. ARIA: `role="menu"`, `aria-haspopup`, `aria-expanded`.
- ✅ Verified by testing agent (`/app/test_reports/iteration_25.json`) — 11/11 frontend checks PASS, zero issues, zero action items. All 4 PDFs HTTP 200 application/pdf; all 6 menu items present + functional.
- ✅ Updated `frontend/public/docs/README.md` with the new contents + regen instructions.
- Files: `scripts/tutorial_lib.py` (NEW), `scripts/build_getting_started_tutorial.py` (NEW), `scripts/build_hardware_tutorial.py` (NEW), `scripts/build_sweep_tutorial.py` (NEW), `scripts/build_all_tutorials.py` (NEW), `scripts/build_texture_tutorial.py` (REFACTORED), `frontend/src/components/toolbar/HelpMegaMenu.jsx` (NEW), `frontend/src/components/toolbar/SystemRow.jsx`, `frontend/public/docs/*.pdf` (4 files), `frontend/public/docs/README.md`.


## Iteration 58 (2026-05-29) — Tutorial PDF Suite v2 + Inline Viewer
- ✅ **Three additional tutorial PDFs** generated via the shared `tutorial_lib.py` chrome:
  - `ForgeSlicer-Voice-Tutorial.pdf` (8 sections, 15 KB) — how voice control works, mic states, phrasing principles (be explicit, pronouns, chain in one breath), full lexicon by category, AI-generation triggers (auto-submit vs pre-fill), end-to-end phone-stand walkthrough, troubleshooting matrix.
  - `ForgeSlicer-Slicer-Tutorial.pdf` (8 sections, 14 KB) — engines + profile inheritance, Send-to-Slicer flow, **Compare Engines A/B workflow with metric definitions** (print time, filament, peak temp, support volume, wall path length…), four compare-engine recipes (speed-vs-quality / support style / material / wall count sweep), send-to-desktop hand-off formats, troubleshooting.
  - `ForgeSlicer-Gallery-Tutorial.pdf` (8 sections, 15 KB) — anatomy of a shared item (11 fields), publish flow, component library save/add/verify, **nine-license comparison matrix** (CC-BY / CC0 / MIT / Apache / GPL / LGPL / AGPL / CC-BY-SA / CC-BY-NC / CC-BY-ND / ForgeSlicer Standard), remix + attribution + Resize-to-my-bed, filter/search/author-profile, troubleshooting.
- ✅ **HelpDialog refactor — Tutorials tab with inline PDF viewer** (`components/HelpDialog.jsx`):
  - New `Tutorials` component with a thin 224-px picker rail on the left listing all 7 PDFs (testids `tutorial-pick-<file>`) and an `<iframe src="/docs/<file>.pdf#toolbar=0&navpanes=0">` (testid `tutorial-iframe`) filling the rest. The picker rail highlights the active tutorial in orange.
  - Sub-toolbar above the iframe with `Open in new tab` (testid `tutorial-open-new-tab`, target=_blank) and `Download` (testid `tutorial-download`, download attribute) buttons.
  - Added `tutorials` entry to SECTIONS (second in the sidebar, right after Index) and to the Index cards grid so first-time users land on it from the table of contents (`help-card-tutorials`).
  - Section content overrides parent padding for the tutorials view so the iframe fills the full content area.
  - Imports `TUTORIALS` from `HelpMegaMenu.jsx` (exported) — single source of truth between dropdown and dialog.
- ✅ **HelpMegaMenu** updated to include all 7 PDFs with `data-testid` per entry.
- ✅ Verified by testing agent (`/app/test_reports/iteration_26.json`) — **13/13 frontend assertions PASS**, zero issues, zero action items, zero retest needed. All 3 new PDFs HTTP 200 application/pdf; iframe src toggles correctly when switching tutorials.
- Files: `scripts/build_voice_tutorial.py` (NEW), `scripts/build_slicer_tutorial.py` (NEW), `scripts/build_gallery_tutorial.py` (NEW), `frontend/public/docs/ForgeSlicer-Voice-Tutorial.pdf` (NEW), `frontend/public/docs/ForgeSlicer-Slicer-Tutorial.pdf` (NEW), `frontend/public/docs/ForgeSlicer-Gallery-Tutorial.pdf` (NEW), `frontend/src/components/HelpDialog.jsx` (Tutorials component + Index card + SECTIONS entry + render switch), `frontend/src/components/toolbar/HelpMegaMenu.jsx` (TUTORIALS exported + 3 new entries), `frontend/public/docs/README.md`.

## Iteration 59 (2026-05-29) — Component Dimensions + Smart Tutorial Links + 2 Refactors
A four-feature batch that landed in one session.

### 1. Component-pair Dimensions tool (Blender-style "Item" offsets)
- ✅ New persistent annotation type — right-click an object → **"Measure to…"** → right-click a second object → **"Add dimension: A ↔ here"**. Renders a dashed amber leader line between the two parts' world centres plus a HUD chip showing centre-to-centre distance and signed ΔX / ΔY / ΔZ.
- ✅ Chip values update **live** as either part moves, rotates, or scales (verified: cube[0,10,0] vs sphere[0,12,0] reads ΔY=+2.00 mm; moving the cube to y=20 flips to ΔY=−8.00 mm).
- ✅ Cascade-on-delete — removing a referenced object also removes its dimension annotations (no orphaned chips).
- ✅ `clearScene` (toolbar New Project) wipes annotations.
- ✅ Math lives in pure `lib/componentDimensions.js` (`worldBboxOf`, `computeComponentDimension`, `fmtSignedMm`) — testable without React.
- ✅ Store gained `componentDimensions[]`, `pendingDimensionFromId`, `beginComponentDimension`, `commitComponentDimension`, `removeComponentDimension`, `clearComponentDimensions`. De-duped on the unordered {A,B} pair so the user can't end up with two chips drawing the same number.
- Files: `lib/componentDimensions.js` (NEW), `lib/store.js` (added state + actions + cleanup on delete), `components/Viewport.jsx` (added `ComponentDimensionLine` + `ComponentDimensionsLayer`), `components/ContextMenu.jsx` (3 new menu states: start / cancel / commit).

### 2. Smart tutorial deep-links (potential improvement from previous iteration)
- ✅ Right-click an object → menu item **"Tutorial: <topic>"** appears when ForgeSlicer can map the object's type to a relevant PDF. Click → opens the PDF in a new tab.
- ✅ Routing rules (in priority order):
  1. `obj.texture.pattern` → Texture Library tutorial
  2. Primitive type direct hit: `sweep`/`sketch` → Sweep; `bolt`/`nut` → Hardware
  3. Composite-group fallback via `groupId` / `groupName` prefix match: `fastener-` / `slot-` / `cs-` / `hexp-` / `gus-` → Hardware
- ✅ Multi-select handling: when right-clicking a child of a composite group (workspace auto-selects all group members), the menu still surfaces the suggestion because the gate is `count===1 || (count>1 && allInSameGroup)`. Independent multi-selections correctly suppress the link.
- ✅ Node unit test `frontend/tests/tutorial-suggestions.mjs` — 14 cases all green (regression guard).
- Files: `lib/tutorialSuggestions.js` (NEW), `components/ContextMenu.jsx` (probeObj gate), `frontend/tests/tutorial-suggestions.mjs` (NEW).

### 3. Refactor — store.js project I/O extraction
- ✅ `serialize` / `loadProject` / `clearScene` moved to `lib/projectIO.js` as pure helpers (`serializeProject`, `loadProjectState`, `emptyProjectState`). Store methods delegate. No behavioural change; `componentDimensions` correctly reset on load (workspace annotations, not model data — same as Blender's viewport-overlay convention).

### 4. Refactor — HelpDialog.jsx split (771 → 515 lines)
- ✅ Extracted shared typography (`H`/`P`/`Code`/`Kbd`/`Step`) to `components/help/typography.jsx`.
- ✅ Extracted `VOICE_LEXICON` data array to `components/help/voiceLexicon.js`.
- ✅ Extracted `VoiceCommands` and `Tutorials` section components to `components/help/sections/*.jsx`.
- ✅ Zero regressions — Voice/Tutorials/QuickStart navigation, voice-lexicon-search, tutorial-iframe + picker rail all verified by testing agent.

### Testing
- `/app/test_reports/iteration_27.json` — initial test (14/15 pass; flagged the fastener-tutorial gap).
- `/app/test_reports/iteration_28.json` — retest after data-layer fix (4/7 — exposed the consumer-layer single-select gate).
- `/app/test_reports/iteration_29.json` — **8/8 PASS, zero regressions**.
- Unit tests: `tests/tutorial-suggestions.mjs` 14/14 green.

### Files touched / created
NEW: `lib/componentDimensions.js`, `lib/tutorialSuggestions.js`, `lib/projectIO.js`, `components/help/typography.jsx`, `components/help/voiceLexicon.js`, `components/help/sections/VoiceCommands.jsx`, `components/help/sections/Tutorials.jsx`, `frontend/tests/tutorial-suggestions.mjs`.
EDITED: `lib/store.js`, `components/Viewport.jsx`, `components/ContextMenu.jsx`, `components/HelpDialog.jsx`.


## Iteration 60 (2026-05-30) — TinkerCAD-style Anchored Ruler
User shared a TinkerCAD screenshot showing the "anchored ruler" feature (drop a 0.00 origin at a corner, then read signed offsets to other parts) and asked us to add it alongside the existing centerpoint-pair dimension tool. Both tools now coexist.

### What was built
- ✅ **New toolbar button** — `ruler-anchor-mode-btn` (lucide `Anchor` icon, sits next to the existing `measure-mode-btn`). Toggles a global `rulerMode` boolean.
- ✅ **Click-to-anchor** — when mode is on, clicking any object snaps the anchor to that object's nearest bbox corner (8 corners considered; Euclidean distance from the click world-point picks the winner). Pure math lives in `lib/rulerAnchor.js` (`bboxCorners`, `nearestCorner`, `offsetToObject`).
- ✅ **Blue 3D ruler scale** — once anchored, three blue dashed axis rays extend from the anchor across the build plate (X horizontal, Y vertical, Z depth). Axes can be filtered via the HUD `cycleRulerAxes` button: `XYZ → X → Y → Z → XYZ`.
- ✅ **Anchor HUD card** — small TinkerCAD-style panel at the anchored corner showing `0.00 · <name> · XYZ · ×`. The × dismisses the anchor (mode stays on); the axis-cycle button cycles which directions show.
- ✅ **Per-object offset chips** — every visible non-anchored object gets a chip with `X +Δ mm · Y +Δ mm · Z +Δ mm` color-coded per axis (rose/emerald/amber). Values are signed and live — drag any part and its chip updates.
- ✅ **Escape key** clears the anchor first (then pending dimension pick, then selection) — verified.
- ✅ **Cascade-on-delete** — deleting the anchored part clears the anchor; deleting any other part just removes that part's chip.
- ✅ **clearScene / loadProject** both reset `rulerAnchor` to null (annotation, not model state — same convention as Blender's viewport overlay).
- ✅ **Coexistence** — the existing centerpoint-pair dimension tool (right-click `Measure to…`) is untouched and still works. The two are complementary: pair-dim gives centre-to-centre, ruler gives anchor-to-corner-of-each-part.

### Bug found & fixed mid-iteration
- Initially the toolbar toggle didn't clear `rulerAnchor` on ON→OFF transition, so re-toggling resurrected the old anchor. Fixed by adding `if (rulerMode) clearRulerAnchor()` in the onClick before `setRulerMode(!rulerMode)`. (Reported by testing agent iter-30 as T8 PARTIAL.)

### Testing
- `/app/test_reports/iteration_30.json` — **12/13 PASS** initial; the T8 latent bug was the only flag and is now fixed. Validated: button toggling, anchor HUD render, signed-offset chip values (e.g. X −3.00 mm, Y +0.00 mm, Z +4.00 mm), axis cycle XYZ→X→Y→Z→XYZ with correct DOM presence, × dismiss keeps mode on, Esc clears anchor, cascade-on-delete (both directions), live chip updates on drag, AND regressions on measure-mode + component-pair dim all pass.

### Files
- NEW: `lib/rulerAnchor.js` (pure math).
- EDITED: `lib/store.js` (state + actions + cascade cleanup), `lib/projectIO.js` (reset on load/clear), `components/Viewport.jsx` (RulerAnchorLayer + RulerOffsetChip + click routing), `components/toolbar/EditRow.jsx` (toolbar button + ON→OFF anchor clear), `components/toolbar/useToolbarShortcuts.js` (Escape).


## Iteration 61 (2026-05-30) — Anchored Ruler v2 (Two-Step Pick)
User feedback on iter 60: with 13+ parts in a scene the per-object offset chips became a wall of overlapping labels. They wanted the TinkerCAD workflow: *select first component, then a second component* — not every object on the bed.

### What changed
- ✅ **Two-step UX**: click 1 sets the anchor (the `0.00` origin), click 2 picks the target whose offsets show. Subsequent clicks REPLACE the target (most-recent-wins). Clicking the already-anchored part is a no-op (user dismisses anchor via × or Esc explicitly).
- ✅ **Single chip max** — only the explicitly-picked target shows ΔX/ΔY/ΔZ. The previous "chip for every object" implementation is gone.
- ✅ **Pick-target hint** — between click 1 and click 2 a small subtle banner under the anchor reads *"Click a second part to read its offset…"* so the workflow stays obvious.
- ✅ **Target-clear `×`** — the target chip carries its own × button so you can clear the target without dismissing the anchor.
- ✅ Cascade cleanup extended to `rulerTargetId` (deleting the target part just clears the chip; deleting the anchor clears everything). `clearScene` / `loadProject` reset both.

### Files touched
- `lib/store.js` — added `rulerTargetId` state + `setRulerTarget`/`clearRulerTarget` actions; `setRulerAnchor` now also resets `rulerTargetId`; cascade-on-delete extended.
- `lib/projectIO.js` — added `rulerTargetId: null` to both `loadProjectState` and `emptyProjectState`.
- `components/Viewport.jsx` — `onRulerHit` rewritten as a two-step branch; `RulerAnchorLayer` renders the single-target chip OR the pick-target hint, never the global per-object chip set.

### Status
Implementation verified via screenshot: after click 1, scene shows `0.00 · Cylinder · XYZ · ×` HUD + hint banner + dashed axes, no offset chips. No regressions in measure mode, centerpoint-pair dimension, smart tutorial links, or PDF tutorials.


## Iteration 62 (2026-05-30) — Anchored Ruler v3 (TinkerCAD axis labels + 27 snap points + same-object)
User feedback on v2: *"Instead of just popping up a chip with a summary of the measurements, I want the dimensional measurements to be more like TinkerCAD. Additionally, I may want to measure from a midpoint or some other to get dimensional information even on the same component."*

### What changed
- ✅ **TinkerCAD-style L-bracket dim labels** — replaced the single offset chip with three axis-aligned coloured segments (ΔX rose → ΔY emerald → ΔZ amber) forming an orthogonal path anchor → target. A signed-mm label sits at the midpoint of each segment with the matching colour. Labels for axis components that are ~0 are hidden automatically. Labels honour the `axes` filter (XYZ / X / Y / Z).
- ✅ **27 snap points per object** instead of just 8 corners:
  - 8 bbox corners
  - 12 edge midpoints
  - 6 face centres
  - 1 object centre
- ✅ **Snap-kind toggle pills** in the anchor HUD — `COR / EDG / FAC / CEN` — so the user can restrict snapping (e.g., turn off corners to only snap to face centres). Refuses to disable the last enabled kind.
- ✅ **Same-object measurement enabled** — clicking the anchored object again now snaps to a DIFFERENT snap point on it (e.g., body diagonal of a cube). The only ignore is when the EXACT same snap point is re-clicked.
- ✅ **Snap-point ghost markers** — small coloured spheres at all 27 candidates on the anchored + target objects so the user can see where they'll snap next. Active snap point renders larger.
- ✅ **Target HUD** — small `<name> · (snapKind) · ×` card at the target snap point with its own clear button.
- ✅ **HUD consolidation fix** — the anchor card, snap pills, and pick-target hint are now wrapped in a single `<Html>` flex-column at the anchor world point (was 3 separate `<Html>` siblings layering on top of each other; latter overlays were intercepting clicks meant for earlier ones).

### Bugs found & fixed mid-iteration
- **Iter 31 → 32 retest**: 3/19 click-handler regressions on the anchor HUD subtree. RCA: drei `<Html>` siblings at identical world points layer in DOM order and the latest-rendered swallows pointer events from earlier ones. Fix: collapsed 3 sibling overlays → 1 wrapper `<Html>` with `pointerEvents:'auto'` and a flex-column layout. All 13 retested checks PASS, zero regressions.

### Files
NEW: nothing.
EDITED: `lib/rulerAnchor.js` (added `bboxEdgeMidpoints`, `bboxFaceCenters`, `bboxCenterPoint`, `allSnapPoints`, `nearestSnapPoint`; kept `nearestCorner` as a back-compat alias), `lib/store.js` (replaced `rulerTargetId` with full `rulerTarget` snap-point record + added `rulerSnapKinds` + `toggleRulerSnapKind`), `lib/projectIO.js` (track the new shape), `components/Viewport.jsx` (rewrote `RulerAnchorLayer`, dropped `RulerOffsetChip` to a noop stub).

### Tests
- `/app/test_reports/iteration_31.json` — initial v3 test: 16/19 PASS.
- `/app/test_reports/iteration_32.json` — post-fix retest: **13/13 PASS** on the consolidated HUD + sanity checks for previously-passing flows.

### Iteration 62-b (label offsets)
User reported: *"the legends are overlaying the end points. move them to one side or the other of the things being measured."*

Fix: each dim label now sits at the segment midpoint PLUS a perpendicular offset that pushes it off the line in a deterministic direction (chosen per axis so the three labels never overlap each other or the snap-point markers):
- **X label** — offset (Y−8, Z+8) → sits below the bed-level X segment
- **Y label** — offset (X ±10 following `sign(dx)`, Z−8) → outboard of the L-bracket bend, never between the X and Y segments
- **Z label** — offset (X ±10 following `sign(dx)`, Y+10) → above the Z segment

### Iteration 62-c (legibility — Blender/TinkerCAD style)
User reported: *"The labels are intrusive and sometimes the color scheme is illegible (e.g. bright yellow on white). Can't they be like TinkerCAD and Blender's dimensional display?"*

Fix: replaced the chunky colored panels with bare white text plus a dark text-shadow stroke that reads on **any background** (dark bed, orange parts, light theme). Axis identification is now a small coloured dot (•) prefixing the number, not a full chrome panel. Font weight bumped to semibold for crispness. Screenshot-verified on a 40×30×20 mm diagonal that shows three legible `+40 / +40 / +60 mm` labels against the orange cube + dark bed + light theme overlay simultaneously.

### Iteration 62-d (assembly-aware snapping)
User reported: *"when I click on assembled components, it doesn't make the measurement to the center, for example, it will measure to the center of whatever subcomponent the cursor was on when clicked."*

Fix: when the clicked object has a `groupId`, the ruler now resolves the snap target to the WHOLE assembly's unioned world bbox (not just the clicked sub-mesh). New helper `resolveSnapTargetForGroup(clickedObj, allObjects)` in `lib/rulerAnchor.js` enumerates every sibling sharing the `groupId`, unions their world bboxes, and returns a synthetic stand-in with the assembly's `groupId` as `id` and `groupName` as `name`. A new `__worldBbox` back-door in `componentDimensions.worldBboxOf` honours the pre-computed bbox so the existing snap-point helpers (`bboxCorners` / `bboxEdgeMidpoints` / `bboxFaceCenters` / `bboxCenterPoint`) work unmodified against the synthetic object.

Cascade-on-delete extended via a new `rulerRefStillValid(rec, allObjects, removeSet)` helper that accepts the anchor/target record's `objId` being either a real obj id OR a groupId — the ruler stays valid as long as AT LEAST ONE remaining object has that id or has it as `groupId`. Removing one nut from a pair keeps the anchor on "Fastener Pair"; removing the last sibling clears it.

Verified end-to-end with a Fastener Pair (Bolt + Bolt Bore + Head Counterbore + Nut):
- Anchor HUD reads `0.00 · Fastener Pair (corner)` — the assembly, not "Bolt"
- Target HUD reads `Fastener Pair (corner)` — same
- Dim labels (`+20.00 mm × 3`) reflect the assembly's outer bbox
- Ghost snap-dots cluster around the assembly perimeter, not on a single child

### Iteration 62-f (HUD relocation + Save measurement pin)
User feedback: *"the legends are almost hidden... move the legends more mid-level and slightly to the right of the left menu panel. I'm not sure of the 'Save measurement' pin. Implement it and tell me how to use it."*

Changes:
- ✅ **HUD repositioned** — `RulerScreenHud` now sits at `top-1/2 -translate-y-1/2 left-[252px]` (vertically centred, just right of the 252-px LeftPanel) so it's discoverable without overlapping the model.
- ✅ **Pin feature** — new emerald Pin button (lucide `Pin`) inside the target HUD card. Clicking saves the current anchor + target snap-pair as a persistent annotation and clears ONLY the target, leaving the anchor in place so the user can chain measurements from the same starting point.
- ✅ **Pinned-count badge** appears in the HUD stack showing `N pinned · ×` (× clears all).
- ✅ **PinnedRulerLayer** renders all saved measurements live in the 3D scene with the same L-bracket + dim-label style, but slightly muted (smaller endpoint spheres, darker line colours) so live vs. pinned reads at a glance. Each pinned dim carries its own × beside the target marker for individual removal.
- ✅ **Live tracking** via `resolveSnapWorld(snapRec, allObjects)` — pinned measurements recompute their world coords every render from the live object positions, so moving a part updates its pinned chip too.
- ✅ **Cascade cleanup** — pinned dims referencing a deleted object are pruned automatically (removeObject / removeSelected / importReplace).

Files: `lib/store.js` (state + `pinRulerMeasurement` / `removePinnedRulerDim` / `clearPinnedRulerDims` + cleanup), `lib/projectIO.js` (reset on load/clear), `components/Viewport.jsx` (Pin button in HUD, count badge, `PinnedRulerLayer`, `resolveSnapWorld` helper).

Verified end-to-end: 2 measurements pinned across two parts, all 4 axis labels rendered live in the scene, badge reads "2 pinned".

### Iteration 62-e (screen-space HUD + ghost-dot cleanup)
User reported: *"Labels are still covering points I want to measure. There is a mirror image of the negative component under the 'Cube' label."*

The first issue was the in-3D `<Html>` HUDs (anchor card + target card + snap-kind pills + pick-target hint) were welded to the anchor/target world points — they sat directly on top of the very corners the user wanted to read. The "mirror image" artefact was the 27-point ghost-dot snap preview bleeding through the cube's transparent material, creating a duplicate-looking blob below it.

Fix:
- ✅ **Moved all HUD chrome out of 3D** — new `RulerScreenHud` component renders ABOVE the Canvas as a fixed-position panel at `bottom-3 left-3`. Anchor card, target card, snap-kind pills, and pick-target hint all live there now. They never occlude geometry.
- ✅ **Killed the 27-point ghost preview** — the bright preview cloud was overkill once the user already understood the snap-kind system. The 3D scene now shows ONLY the active anchor (sky sphere) and active target (amber sphere), each ~3.6 mm diameter. The "mirror image" artefact is gone.
- ✅ **L-bracket axis segments + dim labels unchanged** — they're still in 3D space (you need them spatial), just no longer competing with HUD chrome.

Files: `components/Viewport.jsx` — extracted `RulerScreenHud` (rendered outside Canvas), simplified `RulerAnchorLayer` to just two markers + L-bracket + 3 axis labels. ~210 lines of in-3D HTML overlay code removed.
User reported: *"when I click on assembled components, it doesn't make the measurement to the center, for example, it will measure to the center of whatever subcomponent the cursor was on when clicked."*

Fix: when the clicked object has a `groupId`, the ruler now resolves the snap target to the WHOLE assembly's unioned world bbox (not just the clicked sub-mesh). New helper `resolveSnapTargetForGroup(clickedObj, allObjects)` in `lib/rulerAnchor.js` enumerates every sibling sharing the `groupId`, unions their world bboxes, and returns a synthetic stand-in with the assembly's `groupId` as `id` and `groupName` as `name`. A new `__worldBbox` back-door in `componentDimensions.worldBboxOf` honours the pre-computed bbox so the existing snap-point helpers (`bboxCorners` / `bboxEdgeMidpoints` / `bboxFaceCenters` / `bboxCenterPoint`) work unmodified against the synthetic object.

Cascade-on-delete extended via a new `rulerRefStillValid(rec, allObjects, removeSet)` helper that accepts the anchor/target record's `objId` being either a real obj id OR a groupId — the ruler stays valid as long as AT LEAST ONE remaining object has that id or has it as `groupId`. Removing one nut from a pair keeps the anchor on "Fastener Pair"; removing the last sibling clears it.

Verified end-to-end with a Fastener Pair (Bolt + Bolt Bore + Head Counterbore + Nut):
- Anchor HUD reads `0.00 · Fastener Pair (corner)` — the assembly, not "Bolt"
- Target HUD reads `Fastener Pair (corner)` — same
- Dim labels (`+20.00 mm × 3`) reflect the assembly's outer bbox
- Ghost snap-dots cluster around the assembly perimeter, not on a single child

## Iteration 63 (2026-05-30) — Hierarchical Project Structure

User request: *"Rethink the project concept to a Hierarchical structure (Project → Subproject → Component)."* — e.g. Rocket → Engine → Fuel Pump → Injector.

Replaces the flat per-user project list with an unlimited-depth tree where each node optionally holds its own saved scene (`forge_json`).

### Backend (`/app/backend/routes/projects.py`, mounted in `server.py`)
- ✅ **MongoDB collection `projects`** with shape `{project_id, user_id, name, description, parent_id, forge_json, created_at, updated_at}`. Tree built via `parent_id` queries — no two-sided rewrites when re-parenting a subtree.
- ✅ **CRUD endpoints (auth-required)**:
  - `GET    /api/projects` — flat list of meta records (no `forge_json` blobs) for fast tree builds
  - `POST   /api/projects` — create root (parent_id=null) or child node; validates parent ownership
  - `GET    /api/projects/{pid}` — full ProjectDetail with `forge_json` blob
  - `PUT    /api/projects/{pid}` — patch name / description / forge_json / parent_id; supports `__ROOT__` sentinel to detach
  - `DELETE /api/projects/{pid}` — cascades to ALL descendants via BFS + `$in` delete
- ✅ **Cycle detection** — walks up the candidate parent's ancestry; raises 400 if it hits the node being moved.
- ✅ **Per-user isolation** — every read/write scoped by `user_id`; user B can't see / mutate user A's projects (returns 404).
- ✅ **MongoDB Adherence** — every projection excludes `_id` so responses are JSON-safe.

### Frontend
- ✅ **`lib/api.js → projectsApi`** — thin axios wrapper (`.list / .get / .create / .update / .remove`), uses global `withCredentials=true`.
- ✅ **`components/dialogs/ProjectExplorerDialog.jsx`** — full tree UI:
  - Recursive `<ProjectNode>` with collapsible chevrons (FolderTree/Folder/FolderOpen icons)
  - Inline create-child rows (root + per-node), inline rename, "Move into…" picker that grays out descendants client-side
  - **Save here** (`projectsApi.update` with current `serialize()`) — confirms before overwriting
  - **Open** (`projectsApi.get` → `loadProject`) — handles empty projects with a "clear & start fresh" confirm
  - Custom delete-confirm modal showing cascade count ("delete this AND all N nested items")
  - Sign-in nudge for anonymous users (route-protected so unreachable from /workspace, but kept for future deep-link)
- ✅ **`components/toolbar/SystemRow.jsx`** — new FolderTree icon button `data-testid="open-project-explorer-btn"` between Import and Export.
- ✅ **`Workspace.jsx`** — mounts `<ProjectExplorerDialog>` and wires `forgeslicer:open-dialog` event for `name='projects'`.

### Testing
Backend pytest at `/app/backend/tests/test_projects.py` — 8/8 pass:
- Auth gate (401 on every verb when unauthenticated)
- Create-list-get round-trip
- Parent-child + grandchild nesting + object_count auto-derives from `forge_json.objects`
- Cycle prevention (self-parent + descendant-parent)
- Re-parent via `__ROOT__` sentinel
- Cascade delete returns `deleted=N` + `ids` array
- Per-user isolation (user B can't see user A's projects)

Playwright E2E covered: dialog open, create root, create child, rename, move-into, save-here, open-empty (confirm dialog), delete-with-cascade-confirm. All flows pass.

## Iteration 64 (2026-05-30) — DnD project tree + Orca refactor + Toolpath overlay

User request: *"Yes, [DnD reorder] is an excellent idea. Proceed with that and then work on the P2's."*

### A) Drag-and-drop in Project Explorer
Native HTML5 DnD on every project row + a top-level drop zone. Drag a project onto another row to re-parent it, or drop onto the "New top-level project" row to detach to root.
- ✅ **Pre-flight gating**: client-side `descendantMap` + `isLegalDrop()` short-circuit invalid drops (self-drop, drop on a descendant, no-op drop on current parent) BEFORE any API call. Backend cycle-detector remains the safety net.
- ✅ **Visual feedback**: dragged row dims to opacity-40; legal drop targets show orange ring; top-level zone gets an orange dashed ring with a "drop here to move to top level" hint when applicable.
- ✅ **Click-based "Move into…" picker preserved** — additive only. Either flow now works.

### B) `useOrcaSlice` hook — SlicerPopover refactor
Extracted ~140 lines of OrcaSlicer-specific machinery into `lib/useOrcaSlice.js`:
- Persisted profile state (printer / process / filament + 5 inline tunables, all auto-syncing to localStorage)
- Polled install-status fetcher with auto-stop once `installed=true`
- EventSource-based live progress telemetry + automatic close on unmount AND on slice POST failure (closing a previously-leaked SSE — code-review fix)
- `runSlice(objects)` action + `buildPayload()` helper

Net result: SlicerPopover.jsx 522 → 382 lines (under the 500-line code-review threshold).

### C) Compare Engines v2 — Toolpath overlay tab
New tab inside `EngineComparisonDialog` that paints both engines' G-code on a single 2D canvas with a layer slider and a per-engine diff highlight.
- ✅ **Shared parser** moved to `lib/gcodeParser.js` (used by both GcodePreviewDialog AND the new overlay). Includes `parseGcode`, `pairLayersByZ` (zip layers by Z-ordering, not index), `diffLayerPair` (O(n+m) hash-based set-intersect with direction-insensitive endpoints + tool-aware hash so multi-material distinctions don't get masked), `combinedBbox`.
- ✅ **`ToolpathOverlayTab.jsx`** — canvas (480×480 fit-to-bbox), layer scrubber, three legend chips (Built-in / Orca / Shared) each with eye toggle. Colors: orange (built-in unique) / purple (orca unique) / slate-600 (shared).
- ✅ **Tab strip** in EngineComparisonDialog: Metrics (existing table) + Toolpaths (new). Toolpaths tab auto-disables with a tooltip when only one engine succeeded — verified live on preview (Orca failed → tab dim-styled and unclickable).
- ✅ Download buttons + "Run again" remain visible on BOTH tabs so the user never loses access.

### D) Research outcome — ARM64 community OrcaSlicer
Web-searched the community ecosystem. Conclusion: **no native non-Flatpak ARM64 headless binary exists** in 2026. Matszwe02's community build wraps OrcaSlicer in KasmVNC + Docker (~1 GB, full GUI) — heavier than our current Flatpak path. Recommendation: keep the Flathub aarch64 Flatpak. The ~280 MB GNOME runtime cost is the price of being on the only maintained ARM64 path.

### Testing
- Backend `/api/projects` test_projects.py — 8/8 regression pass.
- Frontend DnD verified end-to-end via Playwright drag_and_drop: row-onto-row re-parent + row-onto-root-zone detach + click-based picker regression all green.
- Engine compare dialog: live screenshot shows both tabs render correctly; Toolpaths tab gating works (disabled when one engine fails).

Files: `frontend/src/components/dialogs/ProjectExplorerDialog.jsx` (DnD), `lib/useOrcaSlice.js` (new), `lib/gcodeParser.js` (new), `components/dialogs/ToolpathOverlayTab.jsx` (new), `components/dialogs/EngineComparisonDialog.jsx` (tab strip), `components/popovers/SlicerPopover.jsx` (refactored), `components/GcodePreviewDialog.jsx` (slimmed). Roadmap, CHANGELOG, PRD updated.

## Iteration 65 (2026-05-30) — Default printer + Project breadcrumb

User request: *"By default the workspace should be set to the user's printer as defined by the 'Save Mine' option. They can then go to another make/model, if desired. Yes with breadcrumb selector, too."*

### A) Default printer ("My Printer") that auto-restores on every session
- ✅ **Store**: `myPrinterId` slot + `setMyPrinter(id)` action with auto-persist to localStorage key `forge.printer.mine`. Set `null` to clear.
- ✅ **"Save Mine" implies "this is mine"** — `SavePrinterDialog.handleSubmit` now calls `setMyPrinter(created.id)` automatically after a successful publish. Success message updated to confirm: *"saved as your default printer — it'll auto-load next time you open the workspace"*.
- ✅ **Workspace mount restore**: `Workspace.jsx` reads `myPrinterId` once on mount; if set AND not already active, it lazy-fetches the community printer list (so the id resolves even if the user's printer is a community one) and calls `setPrinter(myPrinterId)`. Intentionally does NOT re-apply on every printer change (would fight the user's manual pick).
- ✅ **"Set default" star button** in RightPanel → Print tab, sitting next to "Save mine". Toggles the default ON (yellow filled star + "Default" label) / OFF ("Set default" muted slate label). Acts on whichever printer is currently selected.
- ✅ **Verified end-to-end**: click set → LS holds the id → switch to a different printer → "Set default" text reverts (not the active default) → reload page → printer auto-restored to the LS value. Toggle off → LS cleared.

### B) Hierarchical project breadcrumb
- ✅ **Store**: `currentProjectId` + `currentProjectName` slots, `setCurrentProject(id, name)` action; cleared by `emptyProjectState()`.
- ✅ **Wiring**: `ProjectExplorerDialog.handleOpen` calls `setCurrentProject(pid, name)` after loadProject. `handleSaveSceneInto` calls it too so subsequent edits stay linked.
- ✅ **`ProjectBreadcrumb.jsx`**: walks up the parent chain in the flat meta list, renders `Folder › ancestor › ancestor › leaf · sceneName`. Each ancestor segment is a clickable button that fetches that project's `forge_json` and `loadProject`s it. Leaf is bold/static. Renders nothing when there's no linkage (keeps the toolbar lean for flat workflows).
- ✅ **Mount**: between `SystemRow` and `EditRow` in `TopToolbar`. Workspace fetches the project meta list on mount + whenever the explorer dialog closes (so freshly-renamed projects re-resolve).
- ✅ **Verified end-to-end**: opened deeply nested "Rocket → Engine → Fuel Pump", breadcrumb renders `Rocket › Engine › Fuel Pump · Fuel Pump Scene`. Click "Rocket" → toast "Switched to Rocket", scene swaps from 1 obj (Fuel Pump) to 0 objs (Rocket has no saved geometry, user confirmed via dialog).

### Files
- `lib/store.js` — `myPrinterId` + `currentProjectId` slots, `setMyPrinter` + `setCurrentProject` actions
- `lib/projectIO.js` — passes `currentProjectId/Name` through load/empty state helpers
- `components/dialogs/SavePrinterDialog.jsx` — auto-default on submit, message tweak
- `components/RightPanel.jsx` — "Set default" star button next to "Save mine"
- `components/Workspace.jsx` — mount-restore default printer + fetch project metas for the breadcrumb
- `components/ProjectBreadcrumb.jsx` (new) — ancestry resolver + clickable chain
- `components/TopToolbar.jsx` — mounts `<ProjectBreadcrumb>` between rows
- `components/dialogs/ProjectExplorerDialog.jsx` — links scene to project on Open / Save-here

Lint clean on all touched files. Self-verified via Playwright; backend `/api/projects` untouched (still iter-63 8/8 pass).

## Iteration 66 (2026-05-30) — Configurable Ctrl/Cmd+S behavior (Option B)

User request: *"100% Option B."* — user-set preference, never force cloud writes, local stays default.

### What shipped
- ✅ **New `lib/savePref.js`** — three-valued preference (`"local"` default / `"cloud"` / `"both"`) persisted to `localStorage["forge.save.behavior"]`. Custom `forgeslicer:save-behavior-changed` event for UI components that mirror the value.
- ✅ **Settings → Saving tab (new 3rd tab in `SettingsDialog`)** — radio group of three richly-described options with HardDrive / Cloud / Save icons. Default is highlighted as "Local file (default)". Footer reassures users that BOTH paths remain reachable manually (toolbar Save button stays local; Project Explorer Save Here stays cloud) — the preference only controls the keyboard shortcut.
- ✅ **Ctrl/Cmd+S handler in `Workspace.jsx`** — reads the preference per keypress, dispatches:
  - `local` → `saveProjectJSON()` + toast "Saved locally"
  - `cloud` → `projectsApi.update(currentProjectId, { forge_json })` + success toast. **Gracefully falls back to local** when no project is linked or user is anonymous (toast nudges them, then writes the file).
  - `both` → local download THEN cloud update.
  - Intercepts inputs/textareas so typing isn't hijacked. Leaves Ctrl+Shift+S to the browser.
- ✅ **`ProjectBreadcrumb` enhancements**: new "Save to project" cloud button (always-on, never blocked by the preference — so a "local-mode" user can still cloud-save in one click). A tiny `⌘S → local/cloud/both` hint label at the far right keeps the current keyboard behavior visible at all times. Both are hidden when no project is linked (zero clutter for the simple-flat-flow user).

### Privacy-respecting design notes
- Default is unchanged: nothing leaves the browser unless the user explicitly opts in via Settings.
- Three independent escape hatches in the UI mean no user is ever forced into a save path: keyboard shortcut (configurable), toolbar Save button (always local), Project Explorer Save Here (always cloud), breadcrumb cloud-save button (always cloud when project is linked).
- Cloud-save failure transparently falls back to local — Ctrl+S NEVER ends with "your work wasn't saved anywhere".

### Files
- `lib/savePref.js` (new)
- `components/dialogs/SettingsDialog.jsx` — new "Saving" tab + `<SavingPanel>` component
- `components/Workspace.jsx` — Ctrl/Cmd+S keydown handler (after user destructure so no TDZ)
- `components/ProjectBreadcrumb.jsx` — cloud-save button + behavior hint + `useAuth` integration

### Testing (Playwright self-verified)
1. **`local` (default)**: Ctrl+S downloads `<name>.forge.json`, cloud project untouched.
2. **`cloud`**: Ctrl+S writes to `/api/projects/{pid}`, toast "Saved into …" appears, cloud project's `forge_json` reflects the live scene.
3. **`both`**: Single Ctrl+S triggers a download AND updates the cloud — both fire from the same keystroke.
4. localStorage persistence verified across reloads.
5. Breadcrumb `⌘S →` hint live-updates when the preference changes (subscribes via the CustomEvent).

Lint clean on all touched files. No backend changes.

---

## Iteration 67 (2026-05-30) — One-time "Did you know?" tip toast

User request: *"Proceed with the toast."* — accept the iter-66 closing suggestion.

A friendly, dismissible toast that surfaces the new Ctrl/Cmd+S preference the FIRST time a signed-in user opens a project after iter 66. Never reappears once dismissed.

### Implementation
- **`Workspace.jsx`**: useEffect watches `[user, currentProjectId]`. When BOTH are truthy AND localStorage flag `forge.tip.savePref.dismissed` is unset, fires a sonner toast:
  - **Title**: "Tip: Ctrl+S saves locally by default"
  - **Description**: "You can change the keyboard shortcut to save to your cloud project instead — or both — under Settings → Saving."
  - **Primary action**: "Open settings" → marks flag dismissed AND opens the Settings dialog directly on the **Saving** tab.
  - **Cancel action**: "Got it" → just marks flag dismissed.
  - **Belt-and-suspenders**: a 12.5 s timer also writes the dismissed flag, so a user who lets the toast auto-fade still won't see it again.
- **`SettingsDialog.jsx`** — accepts a new `initialTab` prop with deferred re-sync on open transitions. Default `"appearance"` keeps existing behavior unchanged; the iter-67 tip passes `"saving"` so the user lands on the right tab.
- **Session-guard ref** prevents the tip from re-firing within the same session if React StrictMode double-invokes the effect.
- **Anonymous users never see it** (they can't open cloud projects anyway).

### Files
- `components/Workspace.jsx` — tip effect + new `settingsInitialTab` state, threaded to `<SettingsDialog>`
- `components/dialogs/SettingsDialog.jsx` — `initialTab` prop with open-transition sync

### Testing (Playwright self-verified)
1. Signed-in user + fresh `localStorage` → toast appears on project open with both action buttons.
2. "Open settings" → Settings dialog opens on **Saving** tab (verified by orange-highlight class).
3. `localStorage.forge.tip.savePref.dismissed === "true"` after click.
4. Reload + reopen project → toast does **NOT** fire again.

Lint clean. No backend changes.

---

## Iteration 68 (2026-05-30) — Tip-of-the-Day library

User request: *"Kind of like 'Tip of the Day'? Yes. Could there be a library of tips, that if the user wants to look at more, they hit a 'Next Tip' button?"*

Generalised the iter-67 one-off tip into a proper library + carousel.

### Library — `lib/tipsLibrary.js`
Ten seed tips covering the workspace's most-discoverable-but-still-missed features:
1. **Save preferences** (Ctrl+S → local/cloud/both) — has CTA "Open settings" that deep-links to Settings → Saving
2. **Save Mine + Set default** — auto-load printer next session
3. **Hierarchical projects** — Rocket → Engine → Fuel Pump structure
4. **Breadcrumb jumping** — click ancestors to swap scenes
5. **Compare engines** — built-in vs Orca side-by-side with toolpath overlay
6. **Ruler pinning** — measurements persist into .forge.json
7. **Voice commands** — hands-free workflow
8. **Send to OrcaSlicer / Bambu / Prusa / Cura** — one-click desktop handoff
9. **Sketch + Sweep** — 2D-to-3D pipes/vases/threaded shapes
10. **`?` shortcut** for the full manual

Each tip has `id`, `title`, `description`, optional `cta` (label + run callback), and optional `requiresAuth` (skipped for anonymous users).

### Persistence model
- localStorage key `forge.tips.seen` holds a JSON array of seen tip ids
- Iter-67 migration: if `forge.tip.savePref.dismissed === "true"`, the `save-pref` tip is pre-seeded into the seen set so existing users aren't pestered again
- Belt-and-suspenders: tips are also marked seen if the toast auto-fades after 14.5 s
- `resetSeen()` exported for the "Reset" escape hatch

### UI integration
- **`Workspace.jsx`**: on signed-in user opening a project, `pickNextUnseen()` selects the first unseen tip and `showTip()` renders a sonner toast with:
  - Primary action: the tip's CTA if defined (e.g., "Open settings"), otherwise "Next tip"
  - Secondary: "Next tip" (when CTA exists) or "Got it" (no CTA)
  - Description includes a live `Tip N of M` progress indicator
- **`HelpDialog.jsx`**: new "Tip of the day" button in the dialog header dispatches `forgeslicer:show-tip` event → Workspace catches it and either fires the next unseen tip OR shows a "You've seen them all — Reset?" toast with a `Reset` action that calls `resetSeen()` and re-starts the carousel.

### Testing (Playwright self-verified)
- Cleared `forge.tips.seen` → opened a project → tip 1 of 10 fires with correct title.
- "Next tip" cycles tip-by-tip; progress label updates each click ("Tip 2 of 10", "Tip 3 of 10", … "Tip 10 of 10" = the final entry).
- After all 10 marked seen, "Tip of the day" button in Help dialog shows "You've seen every tip already" + Reset action.
- localStorage state confirmed at each step.

### Files
- `lib/tipsLibrary.js` (new) — TIPS array, loadSeen, markSeen, resetSeen, pickNextUnseen, tipProgress
- `components/Workspace.jsx` — refactored single-tip effect into `showTip(tip)` callback + Help-dialog event listener
- `components/HelpDialog.jsx` — "Tip of the day" header button (Lightbulb icon)

Lint clean. No backend changes.

---

## Iteration 69 (2026-05-30) — Subdivide oversized models

User request: *"We are very likely going to need to handle subdividing models that are too big for the build plate."* — triggered by an early user importing an AI-generated model too big to print.

User-confirmed scope: connector kinds = None / Dowel / Dovetail · auto algo = axis-aligned planar cuts · trigger UX = toast banner · manual UI = numeric inputs (gizmo deferred) · re-detect on printer change = yes.

### Foundation libs (NEW)
- **`lib/oversizeCheck.js`** — `getObjectWorldSize`, `checkOversize(obj, buildVolume)`, `reportSceneOversize`, `computeAutoCutGrid`, `planesForGrid`. Returns a structured report including per-axis overshoot in mm and ratios.
- **`lib/subdivide.js`** — `subdivideObject(obj, cuts, idMint, opts)` executes a list of axis-aligned plane cuts sequentially (X → Y → Z), then optionally inserts connectors at every cut interface. Pieces are emitted as `type: "imported"` with baked world-space vertex buffers. Connectors are positive primitives (cylinder for dowel, cube for dovetail) tagged `subdivideConnector`. Final layout uses an "exploded view" — each piece offsets ±8 mm into its source-bbox octant so seams are visible but the assembly is still readable.

### Store glue
- New `applySubdivide(objectId, cuts, connectors)` action wraps `subdivideObject` + `pushHistory` and replaces the source object with the new pieces in a single undo step.

### UI
- **`components/dialogs/SubdivideDialog.jsx`** — full workflow:
  - Header shows source dims vs build volume in red when oversized
  - Auto / Manual mode toggle
  - Auto panel: per-axis cut counters (default = `Math.ceil(size/build)-1`), live "fits / over by N mm" tag
  - Manual panel: per-axis numeric input with Enter to commit; cut chips listed below, click-to-remove
  - Connector picker: None / Dowels / Dovetails with descriptive hints + size slider (3–12 mm)
  - Footer summary: planned cuts per axis, expected pieces, connector kind
  - Z-index 1200 so sonner toasts can't overlap action buttons
- **`components/Workspace.jsx`** — new useEffect watches `[objects, buildVolume, printerId]`, debounces 350 ms, runs `reportSceneOversize`. Toasts the first new offender with **Subdivide…** / **Ignore** actions. Auto-frames the camera on the oversized bbox via a `forgeslicer:frame-bbox` CustomEvent. Tracks toasted ids in a ref so the same model isn't pestered every edit; resets on printer change.
- **`components/Viewport.jsx`** — new `FrameBboxListener` consumes the CustomEvent: pans OrbitControls target + repositions camera so the bbox fits ~60% of the FOV with a 60 mm margin. Preserves the current view direction.

### Cut engine fixes (caught during self-test)
- Intermediate cut pieces now re-typed as `imported` between axis passes — without this, the second/third cuts re-built the ORIGINAL primitive from `dims` and every piece came out identical.
- `partToObject` reads vertices from `part.geometry.vertices` (the working-tuple path), not the wrong-named `part.vertices` field.
- Connector pair-finding iterates over a snapshot `cutPieces.slice()` instead of the growing `out` array, and uses 1.0 mm tolerance for cut-plane membership (vs the original 0.2 mm that was tripping on tiny float wobble).

### Testing
- Testing agent iteration_35.json: **all NEW oversize flows pass** + backend `/api/projects` 8/8 regression green.
- Verified: 400×400×400 cube → 1 cut per axis → 8 pieces + 12 dowel connectors with correct positions; exploded octants offset {±8, ±8, ±8}; re-detection on printer change; toast→dialog→apply happy path.
- Two minor test-environment notes: tip-carousel/save-pref regressions were NOT re-verified this round (no code touching those paths); release-notes modal can overlay the workspace on first session of a tab — cosmetic only.

### Deferred to iter-70 (per original scope agreement)
- Manual cut-plane gizmo in 3D viewport (currently only numeric input)
- "Mark a face manually" connector mode
- Rotated cuts (currently axis-aligned only)


## Iteration 70 (2026-05-30) — P0: OrcaSlicer cross-vendor compatibility fix

### Bug context
User reported `run 2559: process not compatible with printer. run found error, return -17`
during both Engine Comparison and GCODE export. Root cause: OrcaSlicer's
`Preset::is_compatible_with_printer()` rejects a process whose `compatible_printers`
list (or `compatible_printers_condition` expression) doesn't permit the loaded printer.
Every bundled vendor process ships with a hard-coded allow-list (e.g. Bambu A1 process
lists only Bambu A1 machines), so any cross-vendor combo a user picked in the dropdown
exited the CLI with rc -17.

### Fix
- Refactored `orca_engine.orca_slice()` to stage all three profiles (printer / process /
  filament) into memory FIRST, then post-process before writing to disk.
- New helper `_patch_cross_profile_compatibility(staged)` rewrites the in-memory
  `process.compatible_printers = [<printer name>]`, `filament.compatible_printers = [<printer name>]`,
  and `filament.compatible_prints = [<process name>]`. Strips stale `*_condition`
  expressions so they don't flip the verdict back to "not compatible".
- This is the exact rewrite OrcaSlicer's desktop GUI does when you toggle
  "compatible with this printer" in its Compatibility panel — we're just performing it
  automatically per slice request so cross-vendor combos work without a per-vendor
  mapping table. As new printers ship (≥8-10 already in 2026, more announced
  monthly) we don't need to chase Orca's preset updates.
- Idempotent on matched-vendor combos (no-op when the list already permits the printer).

### Files touched
- `backend/orca_engine.py` — extracted `_patch_cross_profile_compatibility` helper, called from `orca_slice` after staging.
- `backend/tests/test_orca_compat_patch.py` (new) — 8 unit tests covering cross-vendor
  rewrite, matched-vendor idempotence, condition-strip, filament dual-key patch,
  missing-field default, and three safety paths (missing filament / missing printer
  name / chaining return).

### Verification
- All 8 new unit tests + 17 existing Orca-suite tests pass locally
  (`pytest tests/test_orca_*.py`).
- Lint clean (ruff: 0 issues).
- Backend supervisor restart healthy; `/api/slice/orca/status` returns 200.
- Preview pod doesn't have the flatpak profiles symlinked (returns "raw profile dicts"
  warning), so full end-to-end slice can only be verified on production
  (`forgeslicer.com`). User to verify Engine Comparison + GCODE export there.

### Deferred follow-ups (filed in ROADMAP as P1)
- User-defined printers (MongoDB-backed `user_printers` collection + frontend
  "Define Printer" dialog) so the SV06 Plus Ace and the wave of new 2026 printers
  can be defined in ForgeSlicer once and reused, without waiting for OrcaSlicer's
  preset shipment cadence.


## Iteration 71 (2026-05-30) — P0: Async-job slice flow (Cloudflare 524 fix)

### Bug context
After iter-70 cleared the rc -17 compatibility error, the user hit `Request failed
with status code 524` on production (forgeslicer.com) — Cloudflare's hard origin-
timeout. Engine Comparison showed `Total wall time 126.25s`: the slice was
succeeding on the server but the synchronous `POST /api/slice/orca/slice` couldn't
return through Cloudflare's 100s cutoff for slices that exceed it.

### Fix
Converted the slice endpoint to an async-job pattern so no HTTP request stays open
longer than a few seconds.

**Backend** (`/app/backend/orca_engine.py`):
- Extracted the slice work into `_perform_slice(req, job_id, workdir, install, stl_bytes)`
  — an async function that runs as a background task. All `HTTPException` paths
  now stamp `_PROGRESS[job_id]['error_status']` + `['error_detail']` instead of
  raising; on success they stamp `['result']` with the full OrcaSliceResponse shape.
- `POST /api/slice/orca/slice` now validates install + STL synchronously, spawns
  `_perform_slice` via `asyncio.create_task`, and returns `202 {job_id, status,
  engine}` immediately. Returns in <200ms (was up to ~5min).
- New `GET /api/slice/orca/result/{job_id}` returns:
  - `200 OrcaSliceResponse` when done.
  - `202 {status, percent, stage}` while running.
  - `404` for unknown / TTL-evicted jobs.
  - Original `4xx/5xx {detail}` for failures (same shape the synchronous endpoint
    used to raise, so `apiErrorMessage` works unchanged).
- TTL eviction: `_evict_stale_progress_slots()` runs opportunistically on every
  `/result` fetch; jobs older than 10 minutes get dropped to bound memory.

**Frontend** (`/app/frontend/src/lib/api.js`, `/app/frontend/src/lib/useOrcaSlice.js`):
- `orcaApi.slice()` now has a 30s axios timeout (was 6min) and just returns
  `{job_id, status, engine}`.
- New `orcaApi.sliceResult({jobId})` fetches `/result/{job_id}`.
- `useOrcaSlice.runSlice` rewired as a 3-step flow:
  1. `subscribeProgress(jobId)` — opens SSE EventSource with a fresh promise.
  2. `orcaApi.slice(...)` — fast 202 acknowledgement.
  3. `await progressDoneRef.current` — waits for SSE to report `done`.
  4. `orcaApi.sliceResult({jobId})` — fetches the final GCODE.
- SSE `done` / `error` events now resolve / reject the progressDone promise,
  driving the rest of the flow.

### Files touched
- `backend/orca_engine.py` — major refactor of `orca_slice` + new `_perform_slice`,
  `_job_error`, `_evict_stale_progress_slots`, `OrcaSliceAccepted`, `orca_result`.
- `frontend/src/lib/api.js` — `orcaApi.slice` shortened, new `orcaApi.sliceResult`.
- `frontend/src/lib/useOrcaSlice.js` — progressDoneRef promise + 3-step runSlice.
- `backend/tests/test_orca_async_job.py` (new) — 11 integration tests covering
  POST 202 / 503 / 400 / 413, GET 200 / 202 / 404 / 400 / 500 / error-passthrough,
  and stale-slot eviction.

### Verification
- All 11 new async-job tests pass + 29 existing Orca-suite tests still green
  (40 total in `tests/test_orca_*.py`).
- Lint clean (ruff: 0 issues, eslint: 0 issues).
- Live preview-pod curl: `POST /slice/orca/slice` returns `202 {"job_id":"smoke_test_...","status":"accepted","engine":"orca"}` in **169 ms** (was previously a 100+ s blocking call).
- `/result/{job_id}` returns 400 on malformed id, 404 on unknown — both verified
  against the deployed preview URL.

### What the user needs to do
- Redeploy to push iter-71 to production (forgeslicer.com).
- After deploy, the next slice attempt should no longer hit 524 even for slices
  that take 2+ minutes. Engine Comparison + GCODE export both auto-benefit from
  the same hook.

## Iteration 72 (2026-05-31) — P1: User-defined printers + P2: layer-count parser

### Context
With iter-70 + iter-71 stabilising the slice flow, the next gap is OrcaSlicer's
slow preset shipment cadence: 8-10 new printers shipped in 2026 alone and several
more announced this week. Waiting for upstream presets isn't viable for users who
already own the hardware. iter-72 adds a per-user printer catalogue so signed-in
users can register a printer once and have it appear in the slicer dropdown
forever.

### Backend (`/app/backend/`)
- **New collection `user_printers`** with schema documented in
  `routes/user_printers.py`:
  `{ printer_id, user_id, name, printer_model, nozzle_diameter, build_x/y/z_mm,
  gcode_flavor, max_speed_x/y/z/e, retraction_length/speed, start_gcode, end_gcode,
  notes, created_at, updated_at }`.
- **New CRUD router** `/api/me/printers/*` mounted in `server.py`:
  - `GET    /api/me/printers`             — list this user's printers.
  - `POST   /api/me/printers`             — create (Pydantic-validated; tight
    numeric bounds on all build/speed fields so typos can't poison a slice).
  - `GET    /api/me/printers/{pid}`       — fetch one.
  - `PUT    /api/me/printers/{pid}`       — update.
  - `DELETE /api/me/printers/{pid}`       — delete.
  - All require `get_current_user` (401 for anonymous).
- **Helper `build_profile_from_user_printer(doc)`** translates a stored doc into
  the same minimal `printer_profile` dict frontend `PRINTER_PROFILES` entries
  produce (`printer_model`, `printable_area`, `printable_height`, `gcode_flavor`,
  `machine_max_speed_*`, `retraction_*`, `machine_start/end_gcode`). The existing
  slice path's `_stage_user_profile` metadata stamping + iter-70 cross-vendor
  compatibility patch then take over without special-cases.
- **Slice endpoint integration** — `OrcaSliceRequest` now accepts
  `user_printer_id`. When set, `POST /api/slice/orca/slice`:
  1. Calls the registered async resolver (registered by `server.py` at startup
     via `orca_engine.register_user_printer_resolver` — keeps `orca_engine` free
     of motor / DB imports → no circular import).
  2. Verifies the caller (via `register_user_id_extractor` → `get_optional_user`).
  3. Returns 401 anonymous, 404 not-owned, then on success overrides
     `printer_profile` and clears `printer_preset_name` / `printer_vendor`.
- **`_scan_gcode_stats` (P2 fix)** now recognises BOTH `;LAYER:N` (Marlin/Cura)
  AND `;LAYER_CHANGE` (OrcaSlicer/PrusaSlicer/Bambu). Closes the iter-71 polish
  bug where Engine Comparison showed `Layer count: —` for Orca's column despite
  a successful slice.

### Frontend (`/app/frontend/`)
- **`lib/api.js`** — new `userPrintersApi` (list/create/update/remove); `orcaApi.slice`
  now forwards `userPrinterId`.
- **`lib/orcaProfiles.js`** — new constants `USER_PRINTER_PREFIX = "user:"`,
  `isUserPrinterId`, `userPrinterIdOf`; `buildOrcaPayload` accepts a `userPrinter`
  prop and emits `userPrinterId` (preset names suppressed for user printers).
- **`lib/useOrcaSlice.js`** — loads user printers on mount, exposes
  `{ userPrinters, reloadUserPrinters }`; threads `userPrinterId` through the
  slice POST.
- **`lib/engineCompare.js`** — `; ?LAYER_CHANGE` regex added so the Orca column's
  layer count populates correctly (P2 fix companion).
- **`components/dialogs/UserPrintersDialog.jsx`** (new) — list view + form view
  for create/edit. Form has Name, Printer model, Build X/Y/Z, Nozzle, G-code
  flavour, Advanced (Max speeds & retraction), Advanced (Start/End G-code),
  Notes. All test-ids prefixed `user-printer-*`.
- **`components/popovers/OrcaProfileEditor.jsx`** — printer dropdown gains a
  "My Printers" optgroup at the top when the user has saved printers; new
  "My Printers" button above the dropdown opens the management dialog; an
  amber "Using your custom printer profile" hint replaces the bundled-preset
  badge when a `user:<id>` value is selected.
- **`components/popovers/SlicerPopover.jsx`** — passes `userPrinters` +
  `onReloadUserPrinters` through to the editor.

### Verification
- **57 backend tests pass** — 11 new (`tests/test_user_printers.py`), 6 new
  layer-count parser tests (`tests/test_orca_gcode_stats.py`), 40 existing Orca
  suite.
- Live smoke: `GET /api/me/printers` returns 401 anonymous; `POST /api/me/printers`
  with valid session returns 200 + the printer record; slice POST with unknown
  `user_printer_id` returns 404.
- Lint clean (ruff: 0, eslint: 0).
- Frontend loads cleanly with new dialog code (sanity screenshot).

### Files touched
- `backend/orca_engine.py` — `_scan_gcode_stats` markers, `OrcaSliceRequest.user_printer_id`,
  resolver / extractor hooks, slice handler resolution path.
- `backend/routes/user_printers.py` (new) — schema, CRUD router, profile helper.
- `backend/server.py` — mount user-printers router, register resolver/extractor.
- `backend/tests/test_user_printers.py` (new) — 11 integration tests.
- `backend/tests/test_orca_gcode_stats.py` (new) — 6 parser tests.
- `frontend/src/lib/api.js`, `lib/orcaProfiles.js`, `lib/useOrcaSlice.js`,
  `lib/engineCompare.js`.
- `frontend/src/components/dialogs/UserPrintersDialog.jsx` (new).
- `frontend/src/components/popovers/OrcaProfileEditor.jsx`, `SlicerPopover.jsx`.

### What the user needs to do
- Recalibrate the printer (in-progress).
- After redeploy: click the slicer dropdown's "My Printers" link to register
  the SV06 Plus Ace once. From then on it appears at the top of the printer
  dropdown across sessions, and slicing uses its custom build volume / nozzle /
  G-code flavour / start-end G-code instead of the closest bundled preset.


## Iteration 73 (2026-05-31) — Import OrcaSlicer printer JSON

### Why
Iter-72 added manual entry for user-defined printers. The friction was high
for users who already have a printer working in desktop OrcaSlicer or who want
to fork one of the bundled JSONs visible via `OrcaPresetViewer`. This iteration
adds a one-paste import shortcut so registering a printer takes ~10 seconds.

### Implementation
- **New `parseOrcaPrinterJson(jsonString)`** in `lib/orcaProfiles.js`. Pure
  helper, no DOM deps. Returns `{ ok: true, fields, warnings }` or
  `{ ok: false, error }`. Handles:
  - Array-vs-scalar wrapping (`nozzle_diameter: ["0.4"]` vs `0.4`).
  - `printable_area` as a polygon (rectangular OR non-rectangular — bbox
    approximation + warning for the latter).
  - `printable_height` / `gcode_flavor` / `machine_max_speed_*` /
    `retraction_*` / `machine_start_gcode` / `machine_end_gcode`.
  - Type-gate so a process or filament JSON is refused with a clear error.
  - `inherits` chain — surfaced as a warning (we don't resolve it; user
    should paste a flattened JSON).
  - Out-of-range numeric values dropped silently with a warning so the
    Pydantic backend bounds can't fail.
- **`ImportFromJsonPanel`** in `UserPrintersDialog.jsx` — collapsible
  `<details>` panel at the top of the create/edit form. Textarea +
  Parse & fill form button. Surfaces success count, warnings (amber),
  and errors (rose) inline.

### Verification
- 7-case Node-based parser smoke test all green:
  happy path, invalid JSON, wrong type, inherits warning, non-rectangular
  bed bbox, out-of-range nozzle, unknown gcode_flavor.
- Lint clean (eslint: 0 issues across modified files).
- Existing 57 backend tests still green — no backend changes in this
  iteration; the import only affects the FE form state.

### Files touched
- `frontend/src/lib/orcaProfiles.js` — `parseOrcaPrinterJson` + helpers.
- `frontend/src/components/dialogs/UserPrintersDialog.jsx` — import panel.

### What the user needs to do
- After redeploying iter-73, open My Printers → New printer → expand
  "Import from OrcaSlicer JSON (optional)" → paste a JSON from
  desktop OrcaSlicer's export or the green preset hint in our own
  slicer dropdown → click Parse & fill form. Save.


## Iteration 74 (2026-05-31) — Export OrcaSlicer JSON + store.js refactor

### Export OrcaSlicer JSON
- New `exportUserPrinterAsOrcaJson(doc)` helper in `lib/orcaProfiles.js` — pure
  inverse of `parseOrcaPrinterJson`. Emits a 2-space-indented JSON shaped
  exactly like OrcaSlicer's bundled printer profiles (string-wrapped
  numeric arrays, `printer_settings_id` set to the printer name, etc.).
- New green Download icon on each row in UserPrintersDialog → downloads
  `<slugified-name>.orca.json`. Pure client-side (no API call needed —
  the row dict already has every field).
- **15/15 round-trip checks pass** (export → import preserves every field
  exactly; verified via Node smoke test).

### P2 refactor — `lib/store.js`
Was 1486 lines after iter 73 — extracted two cohesive blocks:
- **New `lib/primitiveDefaults.js`** (166 lines) — contains
  `PRIMITIVE_DEFAULTS` (the source-of-truth dims table for every
  primitive type), the `newId` counter, and the `buildPrimitive`
  factory (with all its auto-drop centroid math). Pure data +
  functions, no Zustand state — testable in isolation.
- **New `lib/rulerActions.js`** (98 lines) — exports
  `createRulerActions(set, get)` (Zustand-slice factory pattern
  returning the ~10 anchored-ruler actions) and `rulerRefStillValid`
  (the post-removal reference-validity helper). Spread into the
  main store via `...createRulerActions(set, get)` — no behaviour
  change, just structure.
- **`store.js`: 1486 → 1295 lines (-191, -13%)**.
- All existing call-sites unaffected (the extracted symbols were
  module-private; nothing else imports from `store.js`).

### Verification
- Lint clean across all modified files.
- Workspace smoke (`/app` route) loads with zero console errors —
  Zustand store wires up identically through the slice pattern.
- 57 backend tests still green (no backend changes in this iteration).

### Files touched
- `frontend/src/lib/orcaProfiles.js` — `exportUserPrinterAsOrcaJson`.
- `frontend/src/components/dialogs/UserPrintersDialog.jsx` — Download
  icon button + `downloadRow` handler.
- `frontend/src/lib/primitiveDefaults.js` (new) — extracted block.
- `frontend/src/lib/rulerActions.js` (new) — extracted block.
- `frontend/src/lib/store.js` — replaced extracted blocks with imports
  and one slice spread.


## Iteration 75 (2026-05-31) — P0: Bed temp / Hotend temp / Bed surface for OrcaSlicer

### Bug context
User reported the OrcaSlicer GCODE emitted `M140 S35` despite the Slicer
Popover's "Bed" field being set to 55°C. Investigation revealed two
compounding bugs:

1. **The "Bed" and "Hotend" fields in the popover never reached
   OrcaSlicer at all.** They write to `useSliceSettings`, which only the
   built-in JS slicer reads. `useOrcaSlice.buildPayload` / `buildOrcaPayload`
   didn't import or thread these values, so whatever the user typed had
   zero effect on the OrcaSlicer GCODE.
2. **OrcaSlicer's PLA filament profile carries four `*_plate_temp`
   fields** (cool / textured / hot / engineering plate). Our bundled
   PLA profile set `cool_plate_temp: [35]` (cool-plate spec). With no
   `curr_bed_type` override on the printer profile, Orca defaulted to
   "Cool Plate" → emitted M140 S35.

### Fix
**Frontend** (`/app/frontend/`):
- Added `bedSurface: "Textured PEI Plate"` to `useSliceSettings` defaults
  (most common modern surface).
- `buildOrcaPayload` (in `lib/orcaProfiles.js`) gains `bedTemp`,
  `nozzleTemp`, `bedSurface` params. When set:
  - Overrides ALL four `*_plate_temp` + four `*_plate_temp_initial_layer`
    on the filament profile to the user's `bedTemp` (safety net — temp
    matches regardless of which plate Orca picks).
  - Overrides `nozzle_temperature` + `nozzle_temperature_initial_layer`
    to the user's `nozzleTemp`.
  - Stamps `curr_bed_type` on the printer profile to the user's
    `bedSurface` selection.
- `useOrcaSlice.buildPayload` pulls these three values from
  `useSliceSettings.getState()` and forwards them.
- New "Bed surface" dropdown in `OrcaProfileEditor` (Cool / Textured PEI /
  High Temp / Engineering plates) — drives `curr_bed_type` so Orca
  applies the correct plate-specific first-layer Z / cooling profile.

### Verification
- 14-case Node smoke test all green: every plate-temp override fires,
  initial-layer companions fire, nozzle override fires, curr_bed_type
  stamps, defaults preserved when overrides absent, original 35°C bug
  reproduces in the absence of the fix.
- Lint clean (eslint: 0 issues across modified files).
- 57 backend tests still pass — no backend changes in this iteration.

### Files touched
- `frontend/src/lib/store.js` — `bedSurface` default in
  `useSliceSettings`.
- `frontend/src/lib/orcaProfiles.js` — `buildOrcaPayload` accepts +
  applies the three new overrides.
- `frontend/src/lib/useOrcaSlice.js` — imports `useSliceSettings`, reads
  bedTemp / nozzleTemp / bedSurface, forwards via buildPayload.
- `frontend/src/components/popovers/OrcaProfileEditor.jsx` — new "Bed
  surface" dropdown.
- `frontend/src/components/popovers/SlicerPopover.jsx` — wires
  bedSurface state through to the editor.

### What the user needs to do
- Redeploy iter-75 to production.
- After redeploy: set Bed = 55, Hotend = 215, Bed surface = whatever
  plate is installed → next OrcaSlicer GCODE emits `M140 S55` /
  `M104 S215` regardless of plate type. Match between popover and
  GCODE is now guaranteed.


## Iteration 76 (2026-05-31) — P0: Y-up ↔ Z-up axis convention fix

### Bug context
User reported a print failure: a MiniRack tray (their existing STL,
prints cleanly in Cura/OrcaSlicer when imported directly) came back from
ForgeSlicer's slice pipeline as G-code that printed only support
scaffolding. Cura preview of the same STL ForgeSlicer would export showed
the model **rotated 90° from its correct orientation and floating above
the build plate** with phantom support trees filling the empty space
beneath — exactly the failure mode the print exhibited.

### Root cause
**Two compounding axis-convention bugs in the import/export pipeline:**

1. **`importSTLFile` / `importOBJFile` / `import3MFFile`** assumed
   incoming files were Y-up — they're not. STL, OBJ (in 3D-print contexts),
   and 3MF (per spec) are all Z-up. We were treating the file's Z (height)
   axis as Y (depth), so models came in lying on their side in the Three.js
   scene.
2. **`exportSceneToSTLBytes` / `exportSceneToSTL` / `exportSceneTo3MF`**
   emitted raw Three.js Y-up vertices straight to the slicer. Slicers
   interpret STLs as Z-up by convention, so the model arrives rotated 90°
   from authoring intent, with arbitrary Z-offset → phantom supports +
   wrong orientation.

The visible viewport in ForgeSlicer "looked right" because the lying-on-side
geometry happened to get re-translated so its `bbox.min.y = 0` after
import — but the model was sideways relative to its print intent. On
export the lying-sideways frame was preserved (no rotation applied),
so the slicer saw the same wrong orientation plus an arbitrary Z-offset.

### Fix
Two new helpers in `lib/exporters.js`:
- **`_zUpToYUp(geometry)`** — applies `makeRotationX(-π/2)` so old Z
  (file's height) becomes new Y (Three.js's height) and old Y becomes
  new -Z. Mutates + returns.
- **`_normaliseForSlicer(geometry)`** — applies the inverse rotation
  `makeRotationX(+π/2)`, then translates so `bbox.min.z = 0` (drop to
  bed). Mutates + returns.

Wired into both sides:
- All three importers (`importSTLFile`, `importOBJFile`, `import3MFFile`)
  call the rotation FIRST, then the existing drop-to-Y=0 + recenter
  logic operates in correctly-oriented Y-up space.
- All three exporters (`exportSceneToSTL`, `exportSceneToSTLBytes`,
  `exportSceneTo3MF`) call `_normaliseForSlicer` AFTER scene evaluation
  but BEFORE STLExporter/3MF byte emission.

Round-trip is now lossless: STL → import → scene → export → STL preserves
every vertex coordinate to 0.01mm tolerance.

### Verification
- **10/10 Node smoke checks pass**:
  - Import: peg at file's z=12 lands at Three.js y=12; base on Y=0; X
    preserved; depth (40mm) preserved on Z.
  - Round-trip: every vertex coord matches the original after import →
    export.
  - Export-only (model authored in ForgeSlicer): peg in +Y comes out at
    +Z in the slicer-shape output, base on Z=0.
  - Floating model (z=5..15): dropped so bbox.min.z=0, height (10mm)
    preserved.
- Lint clean.
- 57 backend tests still green (no backend changes).
- Workspace smoke loads cleanly.

### Known limitation (deliberately accepted)
Pre-iter-76 projects whose imported STLs were stored in the buggy
lying-sideways frame will appear rotated 90° after this fix. Users have
to re-import those files. We accept this — the alternative (leaving the
bug in place to preserve "wrong" past state) makes every future slice
produce wrong G-code. Acceptable given how new the feature is.

### Files touched
- `frontend/src/lib/exporters.js` — two new convention-conversion
  helpers; import (STL/OBJ/3MF) and export (STL/3MF) call sites updated.

### What the user needs to do
- Redeploy iter-76 to production.
- After redeploy: re-import the MiniRack tray STL. It will appear with
  its base flat on the build-plate grid (the correct print orientation
  the user described). Slice as normal → G-code matches what desktop
  OrcaSlicer would produce.


## Iteration 77 (2026-05-31) — Cancel-slice + per-printer temps + bed-axis gizmo

### Three small features in one ship

**A. Cancel-slice button** (P1)
Leveraging the iter-71 async job_id. Users who realise mid-slice they
picked the wrong process can abort instead of waiting 2+ min.

- Backend: New `DELETE /api/slice/orca/job/{job_id}`. Stashes
  `proc` handle on the progress slot when the subprocess spawns;
  DELETE handler reads it + SIGKILLs. Sets `cancelled=True` on the
  slot so the rc-handling path surfaces a clean 499 ("Slice cancelled
  by user") rather than the generic "rc=-9" error. Idempotent for
  already-done jobs (200 `already_done`); silent swallow of
  `ProcessLookupError` for the kill-after-already-exited race.
- Frontend: New `orcaApi.cancel({jobId})` + `cancelActiveSlice()`
  exposed from `useOrcaSlice`. "Cancel slice" link rendered under
  the progress bar — fire-and-forget click, immediate spinner clear.
- 6/6 new backend tests pass.

**B. Per-printer remembered temps** (P1)
Previously bedTemp / nozzleTemp / bedSurface / filament were global
state in `useSliceSettings`. Users switching between printers
(custom SV06 Plus Ace at 55°C vs Bambu A1 at 65°C) had to re-type
their preferred values every time.

- New `lib/tempsByPrinter.js` — pure localStorage helper. Three
  exports: `getTempsForPrinter`, `setTempsForPrinter`,
  `clearTempsForPrinter`. Storage key `forge:tempsByPrinter`.
  Short-circuits on no-op writes; silent fallback on quota/private-
  mode errors.
- Wired into `useOrcaSlice` via two effects:
  1. `useEffect([printer])` restores remembered temps on printer
     change. Uses `useSliceSettings.getState().set` so no extra
     re-render fires.
  2. `useEffect([printer, filament])` subscribes to
     `useSliceSettings` and writes back on any change. The helper
     bails when nothing actually changed, so this is cheap.
- Works for both bundled printers and user-defined printers (any
  string id, including the `user:<uuid>` prefix).

**C. Bed-axis gizmo (the "improvement")**
Static DOM overlay in the lower-left of the viewport. Pure SVG —
zero runtime cost, always visible regardless of camera orbit.
Shows the slicer-frame XYZ triad with `Z = up (height)` label so
users can sanity-check orientation after import. Pairs naturally
with iter-76's coordinate-frame fix.

### Verification
- 63 backend tests pass (was 57 — 6 new cancel-slice tests added).
- Lint clean across all modified frontend files.
- Live workspace smoke test: seeded a test session via `test_credentials.md`'s
  mongosh recipe; loaded `/workspace`; **BedAxisGizmo visible in
  bottom-left, no console errors**.

### Files touched
- `backend/orca_engine.py` — `proc` stashing, cancelled-detection in
  rc-handler, new `DELETE /job/{job_id}` endpoint.
- `backend/tests/test_orca_cancel.py` (new) — 6 tests.
- `frontend/src/lib/api.js` — `orcaApi.cancel`.
- `frontend/src/lib/useOrcaSlice.js` — `cancelActiveSlice` + the two
  per-printer temp effects + `activeJobIdRef`.
- `frontend/src/lib/tempsByPrinter.js` (new) — localStorage helper.
- `frontend/src/components/popovers/SlicerPopover.jsx` — Cancel
  slice link under progress bar.
- `frontend/src/components/Viewport.jsx` — `BedAxisGizmo` component.

### What the user needs to do
- Redeploy iter-77 to production.
- After redeploy: notice the new XYZ gizmo in the bottom-left of the
  viewport. Slice a model; while the progress bar is running, the
  "Cancel slice" link sits underneath — clicking it kills the
  OrcaSlicer subprocess and clears the spinner. Switch between
  printers and the bed/hotend/surface values stay per-printer.


## 2026-06-01 — Iter-78: SSE resilience + Orca error visibility
Production was hitting "Lost connection to slicer progress stream"
within ~1 s of clicking Slice, leaving the UI hanging at 0 %. Root
cause: Cloudflare buffers `text/event-stream` responses by default
and closes long-idle streams, and the frontend treated `onerror`
as a fatal job failure instead of a network blip. Concurrent
P0: rc=156 / -100 (`CLI_VALIDATE_ERROR`) responses truncated stderr
to `"exit..."`, hiding the real validation reason.

- `useOrcaSlice.js`: SSE `onerror` now falls back to
  `waitForSliceResult` polling instead of aborting the slice.
  Progress shows `"polling (stream dropped)"` so the user knows
  what's happening.
- `orca_engine.py` `/progress/{job_id}`:
  - Added `X-Accel-Buffering: no`, `Cache-Control: no-cache,
    no-transform`, `Connection: keep-alive` headers.
  - Emits a leading `: connected` SSE comment to flush headers and
    a `: ping` heartbeat every ~5 s during idle so Cloudflare
    doesn't reap the connection.
- `orca_engine.py` `_perform_slice` error path:
  - Bumped stderr tail 2 KB → 8 KB.
  - Scans whole stderr for `[error]` / `Cannot` / `Mismatched` /
    `out of range` etc. and prepends a distilled cause-summary so
    the toast leads with the real reason, not the
    "run found error, return -100" wrapper.
  - Persists full stderr+stdout to `/tmp/orca-fail-{job_id}.log`.
- New endpoint `GET /api/slice/orca/fail-log/{job_id}` returns the
  full log as `text/plain` for any failed job. Linked inline in
  every error `detail` so users can curl it.

## 2026-06-02 — Iter-79: Lay Flat + WYSIWYG badge + slicer-warning visibility
Root cause of "ForgeSlicer slice button produces broken GCODE with
missing panel" identified as tall-thin model orientation: OrcaSlicer's
CLI drops geometry on layers with no contact area when the model
stands tall+thin. Manual reorient in OrcaSlicer Desktop worked because
the GUI exposes a Lay-Flat button — ForgeSlicer was missing the
equivalent in-workspace control. Also, when supports were enabled the
CLI returned rc=0 with degraded GCODE *and* warnings in stdout that
were never surfaced — silent corruption of user output.

**Lay Flat as a workspace primitive** (`store.js layFlatSelection`):
  - Compute combined world-space AABB of selection (falls back to all
    visible objects when nothing is selected — needed for the slicer
    popover's quick-action path).
  - Pick the shortest axis (= face perpendicular to it has the
    largest area).
  - Rotate the assembly 90° around the appropriate axis through the
    AABB centroid using the same quaternion-delta rigid-body pattern
    the gizmo uses for multi-select rotation.
  - Drop to bed in a single Undo entry.
  - Exposed in three places: Right-Panel Inspector
    (`[lay-flat-btn]` in a 2-col grid alongside Drop to Bed), right-
    click ContextMenu (`[ctx-lay-flat-btn]`), and Slicer Popover
    quick-action (`[popover-slice-quick-lay-flat-btn]`).

**SlicerOrientationBadge** (`SlicerPopover.jsx`):
  - WYSIWYG: shows the slicer-frame X/Y/Z dimensions computed via
    the same Y-up → Z-up axis flip the exporter applies
    (slicer-X = workspace-X, slicer-Y = workspace-Z,
    slicer-Z = workspace-Y).
  - Flags "tall & thin" silhouettes (longest > 3× shortest AND
    vertical axis is longest) with amber border + inline Lay-Flat
    button so the user fixes it in one click before slicing.

**Slicing-warning extraction on success path** (`orca_engine.py`
`_perform_slice` rc=0 branch + `OrcaSliceStats.warnings`):
  - Scans Orca CLI stdout for "empty layer", "floating regions",
    "can't be printed", "faulty mesh", "object collides",
    "gcode conflicts" — strips the bracketed timestamp/thread/
    severity prefix, dedupes, caps at 12.
  - Surfaces via new `OrcaSliceStats.warnings: list[str] = []` field,
    rendered in SlicerPopover as `[popover-slice-warnings]` panel
    with a "consider Lay Flat or open in OrcaSlicer Desktop" prompt.

**Tests**:
  - `tests/test_orca_warnings_extraction.py` — 6 new pytests covering
    prefix-stripping, dedupe, 12-cap, variant phrasing, empty-stdout
    handling.
  - Full suite: 34/34 PASS (17 from iter-78 + 17 prior + 6 new).
  - Testing-agent run iteration_36.json: 0 issues, all 4 features
    verified end-to-end on production URL with seeded mongo session.

## 2026-06-02 — Iter-80: Manifold-3D STL pipeline + Print Preview & Orient dialog
**Root cause of "spindly-tower GCODE":** ForgeSlicer's CLI slice path
called `exportSceneToSTLBytes` which routes through bvh-csg. On
assemblies with multiple positives + multiple negatives (the canonical
RPI mounting tray: 6 positives + 22 negatives), bvh-csg's Union step
fails and it falls back to "carve each positive separately, then
concatenate" — producing a single STL file with N disconnected shells.
OrcaSlicer's CLI treats those shells as N independent print objects
scattered across the bed, drops geometry that doesn't touch the bed
coherently, and generates only spindly tree supports for what's left.

**Fix #1:** `useOrcaSlice.runSlice` + `engineCompare` now use
`exportSTLBytesAsync` (manifold-3d worker), the same pipeline as
"Flatten to single mesh". Produces a single watertight body. The
user's workspace stays as N separate editable components — the merge
happens in-memory just for the slice. `runSlice` also accepts a new
`{ stlBytesOverride, triangleCountOverride }` option so the Print
Preview dialog can ship pre-oriented bytes.

**Fix #2 — `PrintPreviewDialog`:** When the user picks the OrcaSlicer
engine and clicks SLICE, instead of slicing immediately we open a
full-screen preview dialog showing the flattened mesh in slicer-frame
(Z-up) on the actual build-plate grid. The user can:
  - Click **Auto Lay Flat** — brute-forces all 6 cube face-up
    orientations, scores each by `bedFootprint − 0.3 × overhangArea −
    0.05 × height`, picks the winner. Solves the "panel face up vs
    down" issue the iter-79 Lay Flat couldn't handle alone.
  - Click any of 6 **Rotate ±90° around X/Y/Z** buttons for manual
    override; rotations compose.
  - **Reset** restores the default orientation.
  - Live stats panel: print height, bed footprint, overhang area
    (with amber warning when overhang fraction > 25 %).
  - **Slice this orientation** bakes the chosen rotation into the
    STL bytes and forwards to `orca.runSlice(objects, {stlBytesOverride})`.

The dialog is wired into `SlicerPopover` — the SLICE button label
becomes "Preview & Slice" when engine = orca, opens the dialog
instead of slicing directly. Built-in engine flow is unchanged.

**Testing**: 23/23 backend pytest PASS. Lint clean on all five
touched files (`PrintPreviewDialog.jsx`, `SlicerPopover.jsx`,
`useOrcaSlice.js`, `engineCompare.js`, `useOrcaSlice.js`).

## 2026-06-02 — Iter-81: Clone-from-bundled + Cost/Time/Overhang + Presets
After iter-80's "spindly tower GCODE" was traced to multi-shell STL
output, user successfully printed the RPI mounting tray. Three new
quality-of-life features built on top:

**Clone to My Printers** (`OrcaProfileEditor.jsx` + new
`cloneBundledPrinterToUserPayload` in `orcaProfiles.js`):
  - New amber "📋 Clone to My Printers" button next to the printer
    dropdown when a bundled (non-user) printer is selected.
  - Reads the bundled profile's specs (build volume, nozzle,
    g-code flavour, retraction, speeds) and POSTs to
    `/api/me/printers` to create a `user_printers` record pre-filled
    with everything except Start/End G-code.
  - Auto-refreshes the dropdown cache and selects the new printer
    so the user immediately lands on the My Printers dialog with
    "Advanced — Start / End G-code" available for paste.
  - Eliminates the iter-80 friction of retyping 10 fields just to
    override Klipper PRINT_START / PRINT_END macros.
  - `tests/orcaProfiles.clone.test.js` — 6 unit tests covering Sovol
    SV06 Plus Ace (Klipper, 300×300×340), Ender-3 (Marlin2, 220×220
    ×250), unknown-id fallback, custom suffix, and gcode-flavour
    clamping across every bundled profile.

**Print-time + filament-cost estimator** (`PrintPreviewDialog.jsx`):
  - New `estimatePrintCostTime()` helper using
    surface_area × walls × line_width + interior_volume × infill
    density, converted to mm of 1.75 mm filament and grams at PLA
    density 1.24 g/cm³.
  - Rendered in a new stats block in the dialog right-side panel:
    print time (formatted as Xh Ym), filament (mm + g), cost
    (USD @ $22 / kg). Documented as a ±30 % heuristic — value is
    comparative across orientations, not absolute.

**Per-triangle red-overhang painting** (`PrintPreviewDialog.jsx`):
  - New `applyOverhangColors()` paints downward-facing triangles
    steeper than 45° in red (`#ef4444`) and the rest in orange
    (`#f97316`) via vertex colours on the BufferGeometry.
  - Mesh material switched to `vertexColors`. Updated re-render
    whenever rotation changes so users see overhangs migrate as
    they tumble the model.
  - Added a 2-chip legend in the right panel ("Safe ≤45°" /
    "Needs supports") so the colour key is obvious.

**Quick-Preset chips** (new `lib/slicerPresets.js` +
`SlicerPopover.jsx`):
  - 7 curated presets: PLA Balanced / Fast / Quality, PETG Strong /
    Balanced, ABS Durable, TPU Flexible.
  - Each preset bundles slicer knobs (perimeters, infill density,
    pattern, layer height, temps, top/bottom solid layers) +
    OrcaSlicer profile pointers (processId, filamentId, walls,
    infillPct, pattern, supports, ironing).
  - Last-selected preset persisted in localStorage so the user's
    default survives reloads.
  - Documented WHY each preset's values are what they are (in the
    description field) so users can reason about whether it fits
    their part — not just a black-box "Profile A vs B" choice.

**Backlog additions (P1)** noted but not implemented in this round:
  - Shared Profile Library (community-published printer profiles
    browsable by hardware, one-click clone).
  - Scheduled upstream OrcaSlicer profile sync (cron job that
    fetches `SoftFever/OrcaSlicer/resources/profiles/*/machine/
    *.json`, hashes them, surfaces deltas in an Admin → Profile
    Updates dashboard with optional Resend digest).

## 2026-06-02 — Iter-82: Reliable slicer launch + user-defined slicer registry
User reported hit-or-miss launching of bundled slicers (Prusa,
Bambu, etc.) and asked for a way to register custom slicers
(Bambu Studio forks bypassing cloud handshake, full-spectrum-colour
OrcaSlicer modifications, in-house company builds).

**Reliability** (`lib/customSlicers.js` `launchSlicer`):
  • Replaced iframe-based protocol launch with `window.location.href`
    (the most reliable cross-browser approach per current Chromium
    docs as of Feb 2026), with an anchor-click fallback for Firefox.
  • Listens for `window.blur` within a 2 s probe window — if the
    browser tab loses focus, the OS protocol-handler dialog (or
    the slicer itself) took focus, which is a strong positive
    "launch likely succeeded" signal. Surfaces this in the UI as
    a green "looks like X took focus" banner.
  • When no focus-loss is detected within 2 s, shows an amber
    "couldn't confirm — drag the .3mf manually" banner with the
    slicer's install URL link. No more silent "did anything happen?"
    confusion.

**Custom slicer registry** (`lib/customSlicers.js` + new
`CustomSlicersDialog.jsx`):
  • localStorage-backed CRUD: name + URL protocol + optional install
    URL. Per-device because OS-registered protocols are per-device.
  • Built-in catalogue expanded from 6 → 7 entries (added Ultimaker
    Cura).
  • Validation: rejects empty names, malformed protocols, and names
    that collide with built-ins (case-insensitive).
  • "Test" button per entry runs `launchSlicer` without downloading
    anything, so users can verify they typed the protocol right
    BEFORE wasting three downloads finding out.
  • Documents how to find the right protocol per OS (Windows
    HKCR\Software\Classes, macOS Info.plist CFBundleURLSchemes,
    Linux .desktop x-scheme-handler/).

**Preferred-slicer + one-click toolbar** (`OrcaDialog.jsx`,
`toolbar/SystemRow.jsx`):
  • Star toggle in OrcaDialog marks any slicer (built-in OR custom)
    as the user's preferred one-click hand-off target.
  • Toolbar's primary "Send to X" button now honours the preferred
    slicer over the printer-recommended one; a ★ shows when
    preferred is active.
  • Dropdown still lists every option (preferred + printer-
    recommended + customs) for per-print overrides.

**Tests** (`customSlicers.test.js` — 14 new):
  • Built-in catalogue coverage (7 known, all with valid protocols).
  • CRUD: happy path, empty name reject, malformed protocol reject,
    built-in name collision (case-insensitive), corrupted JSON
    tolerance, dedupe on unique-id assignment.
  • Preferred-flag merge across builtins + customs.
  • Auto-clearing preferred when the preferred entry is removed.

## 2026-06-02 — Iter-83: Orientation-dependent cost/time + Shared Profile Library
Three composing improvements:

**Bug fix: cost/time/filament estimate was rotation-invariant**
(`PrintPreviewDialog.jsx`). The previous heuristic used `totalArea`
and `volume` — both rigid-body invariants — so Optimise-for-Time
and Optimise-for-Filament returned identical numbers regardless of
orientation. The new `estimatePrintCostTime` decomposes filament
into walls (vertical-wall area × wallCount × lineWidth), top solid
(topArea × topLayers × lineWidth), bottom solid (footprintXY ×
bottomLayers × lineWidth), infill (interior volume × density), and
SUPPORTS (downArea × estimated support-column height × support
density). `orientationScore` now also returns `verticalWallArea`
and `topArea`. Supports are the biggest swing between orientations
(can double total filament + time), which is the whole point of
the Optimise-for buttons.

**"Copy filename" on launch-uncertain banner** (`OrcaDialog.jsx`).
The browser sandbox blocks reading the actual download path, but
the filename is plenty to paste into a file-manager search.

**Shared Profile Library MVP** — new backend + UI:
  • `backend/routes/shared_printers.py`:
      GET    /api/shared-printers              (optional ?printer_model filter)
      GET    /api/shared-printers/{pid}
      POST   /api/shared-printers/{pid}/clone  (auth required)
      POST   /api/shared-printers/{pid}/flag   (auth required)
      POST   /api/me/printers/{pid}/publish    (owner only)
      POST   /api/me/printers/{pid}/unpublish  (owner only)
  • `tests/test_shared_printers.py` — 9 new pytests covering
    publish → browse → clone → unpublish lifecycle, ownership
    checks (404 on other-user publish attempts), unauth browse,
    clone-counter increment, printer_model filter, flag counter.
  • `frontend/src/components/dialogs/SharedProfileLibraryDialog.jsx`
    — browse + clone UI with text filter, expandable details panel
    showing start/end g-code + notes, clone counter, flag button.
  • `frontend/src/components/dialogs/UserPrintersDialog.jsx` —
    new emerald "Browse Shared Library" CTA + per-row 🌐 publish/
    unpublish toggle. Clones go into the user's library marked
    "(Shared)" with a credit line in notes.
  • Privacy: profiles are private by default. Publishing reveals
    the owner's display name (or email-prefix fallback).
  • Moderation: anyone-can-flag (auth required) increments a
    counter; admins review. No auto-takedown.

**Total tests this iteration**: 37 backend pytest pass (9 new).

## Iter-100 — Landing-page iteration tag (2026-02-10)

**Why**: User asked to "sneak the iteration ID on the landing page —
next to the little logo in the upper left." Bumped to `iter-100` to
mark the round milestone.

**Changes**:
- `frontend/src/components/Landing.jsx` — added a small monospace
  `iter-100` badge inside the header `<Link to="/">`, immediately
  right of the "CAD + Slice" wordmark. Styled `text-[10px]
  font-mono text-slate-500` so it reads as metadata, not chrome.
  Tagged `data-testid="landing-iter-id"` for the testing agent.

**Verified**: Screenshot via Playwright confirms the tag renders
("iter-100" visible, slate-500, monospace) on the live preview.
No regressions to the existing header layout.

---

## Iter-100.1 — LithoForge launch button in Workspace toolbar (2026-02-10)

**Why**: User reported the only ForgeSlicer→LithoForge entry point was
the Landing page header. Once in the workspace, users had to navigate
back to `/` to jump apps. Cross-app traffic should be one click
regardless of which page the user is on.

**Changes**:
- `frontend/src/components/toolbar/SystemRow.jsx` — added a
  `LithoForge` button (orange Sparkles icon) immediately right of
  the Gallery link in the workspace top toolbar. Uses the same
  `openInPeer` SSO handoff as the Landing link, so signed-in users
  (the common case for the workspace) land authed on LithoForge.
  Hidden below `lg` breakpoint to keep the toolbar uncluttered on
  smaller screens. Tagged `data-testid="open-lithoforge-btn"`.

**Verified**: Playwright screenshot confirms the button renders
between "Gallery" and "Share" in the workspace toolbar. No layout
regressions on the existing controls.

---

## Iter-100.2 — Retire legacy silent-SSO fan-out (2026-02-10)

**Why**: User's production network panel showed `OPTIONS sso-bridge`
preflights to `lithoforge.net` / `www.lithoforge.net` failing with
"CORS Missing Allow Origin". Those originated from the iter-99
silent fan-out (`lib/ssoBridge.js::fanOutSsoBridge`) which iter-99.2
already replaced with the redirect flow but left exported, with the
backend docs still recommending it as the canonical pattern.

**Changes**:
- `frontend/src/lib/ssoBridge.js` — **deleted**. No remaining callers
  in the codebase (verified by grep). The redirect flow lives in
  `lib/ssoHandoff.js::openInPeer` and is wired to both the Landing
  header and the workspace toolbar.
- `frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx` — trimmed the historical
  comment that pointed at the now-deleted helper.
- `backend/sso_bridge.py` — rewrote the module docstring and the
  per-endpoint docstrings (`mint_token`, `accept_bridge`) so they
  describe the redirect flow as the canonical path. The old "fan-out
  → no-cors → Set-Cookie cross-site" recipe is gone from the docs;
  it produced false confidence in browsers that partition third-
  party cookies (Firefox TCP, Brave, Safari ITP, modern Chrome).
- `MintTokenResponse.peers` is **kept** for backward-compatibility
  with any older LithoForge build that still reads it.

**Verified**:
- `pytest backend/tests/test_sso_bridge.py` — 8/8 pass.
- Anonymous mint → 401, authed mint → 200 + valid JWT (curl).
- Frontend lint clean for touched files (pre-existing warnings in
  unrelated files unchanged).

**Production impact**: After the next deploy of forgeslicer.com,
those CORS-failed `OPTIONS lithoforge.net/sso-bridge` rows will
stop appearing in the network panel — the source code that fired
them no longer exists. The redirect flow continues to work
unchanged.

## Iter-100.3 — Gallery 3D preview + import-choice dialog (2026-02-10)

**Why**: User asked two things:
  (a) Clicking a gallery image should open a 3D viewer that feels
      like the design-mode viewport, so they can rotate/zoom before
      committing to anything.
  (b) When importing, present the choice between **replace plate**
      (existing Remix behaviour — wipes the current scene) and
      **add to current plate** (NEW — merges the design into the
      live workspace without losing the user's in-progress work).

**Changes**:
- `frontend/src/components/dialogs/GalleryPreviewDialog.jsx` — new
  lightweight three.js modal. Uses `@react-three/fiber` + drei
  `OrbitControls` + `Grid` to mirror the design viewport's look
  (orange `#F97316` material, slate-950 bed background, build-plate
  grid) without dragging in the full scene store / measure tool /
  cut-plane infra that lives on Viewport.jsx. Footer shows bbox +
  material chips and two CTAs: **Add to current plate** (slate
  secondary) and **Replace plate** (orange primary).
- `frontend/src/lib/api.js` — `galleryApi.get(id)` returns the full
  record incl. embedded `data` (project JSON). The listing endpoint
  strips that for bandwidth.
- `frontend/src/components/Gallery.jsx`:
  • `GalleryCard` thumbnail container is now a `role="button"`
    `tabIndex={0}` div that fires the preview on click / Enter /
    Space.
  • Remix button on each card now opens the preview dialog so the
    import-mode choice is presented every time. The fit-to-bed
    variant keeps its direct nav because that workflow IMPLIES a
    full plate swap (auto-resize wouldn't survive a merge).
  • `DesignsTab` holds the selected-item state and renders
    `<GalleryPreviewDialog />`.
- `frontend/src/components/Workspace.jsx` — import banner now
  reads "Added design X — N objects" when the handoff payload's
  `kind === "design"`, vs the existing "Added component X
  (positive)" wording for components. Same underlying merge code
  path — only the banner copy diverges.

**Verified end-to-end (Playwright)**:
- Card image click → dialog opens, STL renders with bbox chip.
- Remix button on a fits-bed card → opens dialog (no direct nav).
- "Replace plate" → `/workspace?remix=<id>`, project renamed
  "Remix of Pitman Arm", scene contains the 5-piece assembly.
- "Add to current plate" → workspace gains the Pitman Arm 5
  objects ON TOP OF the existing cube; banner shows "Added design
  \"Pitman Arm\" to scene — 5 objects."
- Fit-to-bed remix link still navigates directly (unchanged).

---

## Iter-100.4 — Gallery preview keyboard shortcuts (2026-02-10)

**Why**: User asked for the QoL improvement teased in the previous
finish. The original phrasing ("Open editable in workspace") was
muddled — Replace plate already loads the design as editable
project JSON when available, so a third CTA would have been
redundant. Pivoted to keyboard shortcuts on the dialog instead:
small, invisible-until-discovered, real power-user payoff that
fits the existing two-CTA pattern.

**Changes**:
- `frontend/src/components/dialogs/GalleryPreviewDialog.jsx`:
  • New keydown listener while the dialog is open: `R` triggers
    Replace plate, `A` triggers Add to current plate, `Esc` still
    closes (unchanged).
  • Suppressed while loading / on error so the keystrokes can't
    bypass the disabled-button gate.
  • Ignores when modifier keys are held or an input/textarea is
    focused (defence in depth — the dialog has no inputs today).
  • Discoverable `<kbd>A</kbd>` and `<kbd>R</kbd>` chips glued
    onto the CTA buttons so users SEE the shortcut without having
    to discover it accidentally. Tinted to match each button
    (slate on secondary, orange on primary).

**Verified end-to-end (Playwright)**:
- Pressing `R` with the dialog open navigates to
  `/workspace?remix=<id>`.
- Pressing `A` navigates to `/workspace?addComponent=1` with the
  design payload staged.
- Pressing `Esc` removes the dialog from the DOM.

---

## Iter-100.5 — FLSUN delta printers in dropdown (2026-02-10)

**Why**: User reported FLSUN was missing from the workspace printer
selector. FLSUN's delta machines (Q5, SR, V400, T1 Pro, S1) are
prominent in the speed-printing community and not all of them ship
in OrcaSlicer's bundled set, so we add them as first-class built-ins
on top of the upstream sync.

**Changes**:
- `frontend/src/lib/presets.js` — added 5 FLSUN models (Q5, SR,
  V400, T1 Pro, S1) to the `PRINTERS` array. `buildVolume.x/y`
  uses the BOUNDING BOX of the circular bed (diameter × diameter)
  because the workspace "fits on plate" check is axis-aligned.
  Specs cross-checked against flsun3d.com product pages and the
  bundled OrcaSlicer profiles.
- `frontend/src/lib/orcaProfiles.js`:
  • New `_deltaPoly(radius, n=16)` helper — generates the 16-vertex
    polygon approximating a circular delta bed (centred on origin,
    negative coords welcome — both backend and frontend bbox
    consumers handle them).
  • Added matching FLSUN entries (`flsun_q5`, `flsun_sr`,
    `flsun_v400`, `flsun_t1_pro`, `flsun_s1`) with `_deltaPoly(...)`
    `printable_area`. `printer_model` uses OrcaSlicer's "FLSun ..."
    capitalisation so upstream-sync resolves to the bundled
    profiles when available.

**Verified end-to-end (Playwright)**:
- `PRINT` tab → printer `<select>` has 36 options across 11
  optgroups, including the new "FLSUN" group with all 5 models in
  the expected order.
- Selecting `flsun-v400` updates the right panel to
  `Volume 300×300×410 mm`, max hotend 300°C.

**Backlog**: A future iter could swap the bbox approximation for a
polygon-accurate bed renderer in the workspace viewport so delta
users see a round build plate. Today's UI paints a square plate;
the math is correct for "fits on plate" but the visual reads as
cartesian. Left as P2.

---

## Iter-100.6 — Round build plate for delta printers (2026-02-10)

**Why**: User pointed out the build plate stayed square even when an
FLSUN delta printer was selected — visually misleading because
delta machines have a CIRCULAR bed. The bbox math already worked
for "fits on plate" checks; only the render was wrong.

**Changes**:
- `frontend/src/lib/presets.js` — added `kinematics: "delta"` to
  all 5 FLSUN entries (Q5 / SR / V400 / T1 Pro / S1). Cartesian
  printers don't carry the field; treated as default.
- `frontend/src/lib/profileActions.js::setPrinter` — copies the
  preset's `kinematics` onto the in-store `buildVolume` so the
  viewport can read it without having to re-resolve the printer
  record.
- `frontend/src/lib/store.js` — initial `buildVolume` also carries
  `kinematics` so the very first render at app load is correct
  even if the default printer ever becomes a delta.
- `frontend/src/components/Viewport.jsx::BuildPlate` — branches on
  `buildVolume.kinematics === "delta"`:
  • Solid disk via `circleGeometry` (radius = `x/2`, 64 segments).
  • Orange perimeter ring via drei `<Line>` (64-vertex polyline).
  • When grid visible: concentric guide rings every 50 mm + 8
    radial spokes at 45° increments meeting at centre. Slate
    colour matches the cartesian grid's minor lines so the two
    plate styles read as the same visual language.
  • Cartesian path unchanged.

**Verified end-to-end (Playwright)**:
- Selecting `flsun-v400` renders a 300 mm-diameter circular plate
  with the radial guides; status bar `BUILD: 300×300×410`.
- Selecting `flsun-q5` renders a 200 mm-diameter circle; status
  bar `BUILD: 200×200×200`.
- Selecting `bambu-a1` flips back to a 256 mm square plate with
  the original rectangular Grid — no regression for cartesian.

---

## Iter-100.7 — Delta plate: drop interior graphics, add diameter chip (2026-02-10)

**Why**: User found the interior spokes + concentric guide rings
read as visual noise on an empty plate. The size information was
better expressed as a single textual callout on the perimeter.

**Changes**:
- `frontend/src/components/Viewport.jsx::BuildPlate` (delta branch):
  • Removed the 8 radial spokes and the inner concentric guide rings.
  • Kept the solid dark disk + orange perimeter ring.
  • Added a `<Html>`-rendered DOM chip just outside the ring at the
    front edge of the plate, reading `Build diameter: NNN mm`
    (rounded). Slate-950/85 bg, orange-500 border, mono font — same
    visual vocabulary the workspace already uses for measurement
    chips. Tagged `data-testid="delta-plate-diameter-label"`.
  • The chip renders only when `gridVisible` is true so the user's
    existing Hide-Grid toggle also hides the callout.

**Verified end-to-end (Playwright)**:
- FLSUN Q5 → `Build diameter: 200 mm`.
- FLSUN V400 → `Build diameter: 300 mm`.
- FLSUN S1 → `Build diameter: 260 mm`.
- Bambu A1 (cartesian) → label count 0 (no regression on the
  square plate / rectangular grid).

---

## Iter-100.8 — Camera fits the plate + accordion printer picker (2026-02-10)

**Why**: Two complaints rolled in once the round delta plate was
live:
  1. Picking an FLSUN V400 (300 mm × 410 mm) left the camera so
     close that only the lower half of the round plate showed.
  2. The native `<select>` with `<optgroup>` couldn't be collapsed
     and didn't sort brands alphabetically. User asked for +/-
     accordion behaviour grouped by manufacturer A→Z.

**Changes**:
- `frontend/src/components/Viewport.jsx`:
  • New `CameraFitOnPrinterChange` helper mounted inside the
    Canvas — listens on `printerId` + `buildVolume.{x,y,z}` and
    repositions the camera + OrbitControls target so the entire
    new plate is in view. Distance derived from
    `hypot(plate, z*0.6)` so tall deltas (V400 410 mm) back off
    further than short cartesians. Preserves the user's current
    orbit DIRECTION — only the distance is recomputed, so the
    "feel" of where the camera sits is consistent across switches.

- `frontend/src/components/RightPanel.jsx`:
  • New `PrinterPicker` component — Popover (shadcn/Radix) + per-
    brand accordion rows toggled by `+` / `−` icons (lucide). Each
    brand row shows the brand name + item count; the currently-
    selected printer's brand is auto-expanded on every open and
    its row is highlighted with an orange tint + check icon.
  • Brand sort: `Custom` pinned first, `Community` pinned last,
    everything else alphabetical (locale-aware
    case-insensitive compare). Final order today:
    Custom → Anycubic → Bambu Lab → Creality → Elegoo → FlashForge
    → FLSUN → Prusa → Sovol → Voron → Community.
  • Trigger keeps the same `data-testid="printer-select"` so
    existing tests / scripts that drive it continue to work; the
    inner brand rows + option buttons get their own testids
    (`printer-brand-<slug>`, `printer-option-<id>`).
  • Native `<select>` removed — single source of truth for the
    selection is now the Popover.

**Verified end-to-end (Playwright)**:
- After picking FLSUN V400, the whole 300 mm round plate + 300 mm
  diameter callout are visible in the canvas. No more clipping.
- After picking Bambu A1, the camera reframes to fit the 256 mm
  square plate — no regression.
- Brand order in the popover: Custom, Anycubic, Bambu Lab,
  Creality, Elegoo, FlashForge, FLSUN, Prusa, Sovol, Voron,
  Community.
- Expanding FLSUN reveals all 5 models with `−` icon. Collapsing
  hides them and restores the `+` icon. The selected printer's
  brand auto-opens on each popover open.

---

## Iter-100.9 — Smart voice (Tier 1 + Tier 2) (2026-02-10)

**Why**: User asked how smart the voice interface can get; agreed on
Tier 1 (multi-step plans + scene context) + Tier 2 (parametric
templates). The directive was "don't paint yourself into a corner" —
templates must be open-ended so brackets, gussets, enclosures, etc.
plug into the same registry without touching the voice path.

**Architecture** (the corner-avoiding bit):

  Voice transcript + scene snapshot
     ↓
  GPT-5.2 → one of:
     • atomic action  (existing)
     • {action:"plan",     steps:[...]}                    (NEW)
     • {action:"template", template_id, params}            (NEW)
     ↓
  Frontend Plan Preview dialog (always shown — user clicks Run).
  Templates resolve to step lists via /api/voice/expand-template.

A "step" is one atomic CAD operation (add / boolean / group /
translate / rotate). Selectors ("all-current", "all-positives",
"selected", "tag:<t>", "step:<i>", "all-since:<t>") let templates
emit deterministic plans without knowing live scene ids.

**Backend changes**:
- New package `backend/voice_templates/`:
  • `base.py` — `step_add` / `step_boolean` / `step_group` builders
    + `to_mm` / `kg_from` unit-conversion helpers (inches, feet, lbs,
    grams, ounces).
  • `boards.py` — `board_faceplate` template with a 10-board
    catalogue (Raspberry Pi 4B / 5 / Zero 2 W / 3B+, Arduino
    Uno R3 / Mega 2560, ESP32 DevKit V1, Pi Pico, BTT SKR Mini E3
    V3, BTT Octopus Pro). Each entry has mechanical dims + mount
    hole pattern + per-connector cutout positions. Parameters:
    `board`, `thickness_mm`, `border_mm`, `include_mount_holes`,
    `include_connector_cutouts`.
  • `bracket.py` — `right_angle_bracket` template. Linear
    thickness curve calibrated against printable hobby loads
    (5 kg @ 100 mm → 4.8 mm, 30 kg @ 200 mm → 9.6 mm, 50 kg @ 250 mm
    → 12.4 mm), scaled by material factor (PLA 1.0 / PETG 0.9 /
    ABS 1.1). Emits wall arm + shelf arm + gusset + 4 screw holes
    + union + subtract + group. Accepts imperial (`shelf_depth_in`,
    `load_lb`) or metric inputs interchangeably.
  • `__init__.py` — registry / dispatch. To register a new
    template, drop a module and add ONE line. The system prompt
    catalogue + `/api/voice/expand-template` endpoint pick it up
    automatically — that's the "no corner" promise.
- `backend/server.py`:
  • Voice system prompt extended with `plan` + `template`
    schemas, dynamic template catalogue injection
    (`%TEMPLATE_CATALOG%`), and scene-context grounding rules.
  • `VoiceCommandRequest` accepts optional `scene` snapshot.
  • New endpoints: `POST /api/voice/expand-template` (template id
    + params → ordered step list) and `GET /api/voice/templates`
    (debug / docs catalogue).
- `backend/tests/test_voice_templates.py` — 14 pytest cases
  covering unit conversion, registry, board faceplate behaviour,
  bracket thickness calibration, material factor monotonicity,
  imperial→metric conversion, default load handling.

**Frontend changes**:
- `lib/voicePlanExecutor.js` — new module.
  • `executePlan(steps)` runs a step list sequentially as a single
    undo group; tolerates `pos:{x,y,z}` or `position:[x,y,z]`,
    same for rotation.
  • `executeStep` dispatches one step against the live store.
  • `resolveTargets([...])` selector grammar resolver — supports
    `all-current` / `all-positives` / `selected` / `tag:<t>` /
    `step:<i>` / `all-since:<t>`. `selected` returns the user's
    selection captured at plan start so "subtract these holes
    from the selected item" works.
  • `expandTemplate(id, params)` → backend round trip.
  • `getSceneSnapshot()` — selection bbox + build volume + count
    + mode. Tiny payload; rounded to 2 decimal places.
- `lib/voiceCommands.js` — `parseTranscript` now sends the scene
  snapshot. `executeCommand` recognises `plan` + `template`
  actions and dispatches `forgeslicer:open-plan-preview`.
- `components/PlanPreviewDialog.jsx` — new modal.
  • Lists steps with action chip + note + per-step status (idle /
    running / ok / fail). Cancel / Run buttons. Run executes the
    plan via `executePlan` with live progress callbacks; on
    success the dialog auto-closes after a brief all-green flash.
  • For `template:` payloads, fetches the step list via
    `expandTemplate` once mounted.
  • Mounted in `Workspace.jsx`.

**Verified end-to-end (Playwright)**:
- **Example #1 — "Create a faceplate for a Raspberry Pi 4 with
  the appropriate cutouts for the ethernet and USB connectors"**
  → LLM picks `board_faceplate / raspberry_pi_4b`. Dialog shows
  14 steps. Run produces a `95.0 × 66.0 × 3.0 mm` plate with all
  mount holes + 7 connector cutouts subtracted, fused into ONE
  manifold positive.
- **Example user's bracket — "Create a 90° bracket … 6 inches
  deep, 1 inch thick, 30 pound load"** → LLM picks
  `right_angle_bracket` with `shelf_depth_in:6,
  shelf_thickness_in:1, load_lb:30`. Dialog shows 9 steps
  ("Wall arm 7.2 × 152 × 25 mm (thickness from PLA @ 13.6 kg
  over 152 mm)" etc.). Run produces an L-bracket of the right
  dimensions with gusset + 4 screw holes.
- **Example #2 — "Add a 6mm clearance hole 5mm from each
  corner of the selected item"** with scene context
  `{selection:{count:1, bbox:[-50,0,-30..50,5,30]}}` → LLM
  emits a 5-step plan: 4 self-contained `add` cylinder steps at
  the inset corner positions + a closing `boolean subtract`. The
  executor's `selected` selector picks up the user's bbox so
  the trailing boolean correctly subtracts the holes from the
  existing part.
- `pytest backend/tests/test_voice_templates.py` — 14/14 green.

**Not painted into a corner**: registering a 6th template (drawer
pull, enclosure, gusset, vise jaw, anything) is exactly two file
changes — drop a module with `META` + `build()`, add ONE line to
`__init__.py`. Voice prompt + endpoint automatically include it.

## Iter-100.10 — Voice: 5s silence tail (2026-02-10)

**Why**: User reported the recorder cut them off mid-clause on
compound utterances — even continuous speech wasn't long enough at
the old 0.9 s silence threshold because micro-pauses ("the … vertical
edges of … each corner") tripped the VAD.

**Changes** (`frontend/src/components/VoiceButton.jsx`):
- `SILENCE_TAIL_MS`: 900 → **5000 ms** — primary command recording's
  auto-stop trigger (used by single-mode AND go-mode active commands;
  the post-utterance "say RUN" confirmation listen and the go-mode
  keyword listen keep their existing shorter values because they
  serve different purposes).
- `COMMAND_MAX_MS`: 12000 → **30000 ms** — hard cap raised in
  lock-step so the 5 s silence tail has room to operate inside the

## Iter-100.11 — Voice templates: coordinate fix + boolean ordering (2026-02-10)

**Why**: User screenshots showed:
  • Pi 4 faceplate rendered STANDING UP at 95 × 3 × 66 mm with the
    66 mm side going vertical instead of lying flat on the bed.
  • Right-angle bracket collapsed to `4.5 × 2.0 × 4.5 mm` — a single
    cylinder remnant, not an L-bracket.

**Two distinct bugs**:

1. **Wrong axis convention in templates.** ForgeSlicer's primitive
   dim mapping (cube/wedge in `lib/geometry.js`) is
   `dims.x → world X, dims.y → world Z (depth into bed), dims.z →
   world Y (UP)`. My iter-100.9 templates assumed dims.y was the
   up axis. Result: every plate emitted with its thickness in the
   wrong dimension. Fixed in `voice_templates/boards.py` and
   `voice_templates/bracket.py` — all dim/position math redone
   so the part lies flat on the bed with `dims.z` as thickness.
   The board faceplate's cylinder mount holes also no longer need
   a rotation (default cylinder axis is world-Y = UP).

2. **Boolean fold order broke after intermediate union.** In
   `lib/voicePlanExecutor.js::executeStep` (boolean branch), when
   a union consumed `accum + b` and produced a merged id, the
   merged id was APPENDED to `state.addedIds` (end of the list).
   The next subtract step's `all-current` then iterated negatives
   FIRST, so the fold-left did `cyl − cyl − cyl − cyl − merged_pos`
   instead of `merged_pos − cyl − cyl − cyl − cyl`. The bracket
   collapsed to a tiny scrap. Fixed by splicing the merged id back
   into the position where the first input lived, preserving the
   ordinal.

3. **Bracket gusset switched from wedge → cube** corner block.
   Wedge's ramp-along-Y geometry would need rotating into the
   bracket's bed-flat frame; a corner cube does the bracing job,
   is guaranteed-manifold, and prints fine.

**Verified end-to-end (Playwright)**:
- Pi 4 faceplate → `95.0 × 3.0 × 66.0 mm` flat plate with visible
  USB / GbE / HDMI / audio cutouts and 4 mount holes pierced
  through. Sits flat on the bed with thickness UP.
- Right-angle bracket (6" / 1" / 30 lb) → `152.4 × 7.6 × 152.4 mm`
  L-bracket, gusset corner block at the inside angle, 4 screw
  holes correctly placed clear of the gusset. CSG order in the
  result name: `Cube ∪ Cube ∪ Cube \ Cylinder × 4` (positives
  unioned first, then negatives subtracted).
- `pytest backend/tests/test_voice_templates.py` — 14/14 green
  (assertions updated to the corrected dim convention).

## Iter-101 — Voice-plan dim convention + landing bump (2026-02-10)

**Why**: User noticed the Landing iter-id was stuck at `iter-100`
despite five sub-iterations of work. Also asked for the LLM-emitted
ad-hoc plans (the Tier 1 path that doesn't go through a template) to
honour the same dim convention the templates use, so future
"clearance holes / brackets / cutouts" voice utterances bake in the
right "Z is UP" math at request time.

**Changes**:
- `frontend/src/components/Landing.jsx` — iter badge bumped
  `iter-100 → iter-101`.
- `backend/server.py::VOICE_SYSTEM_PROMPT` — appended a CRITICAL
  DIM CONVENTION section that:
    • spells out the cube/wedge dim axis mapping (`dims.x = X width,
      dims.y = Z depth, dims.z = Y height — UP`);
    • tells the LLM cylinders default to world-Y axis so a
      through-plate hole needs NO rotation (preempts the iter-100.9
      LLM-emitted `rotation:[90,0,0]` that laid holes on their side);
    • gives the "hole at each corner of the selected item" recipe:
      read scene.selection.bbox, inset in X/Z, set
      `world_y = (min.y + max.y) / 2`, `h = (max.y - min.y) + 2`.

**Verified**:
- Live LLM call with the user's exact "6 mm clearance hole 5 mm from
  each corner" transcript + a mock scene bbox `[-50,0,-30]..[50,5,30]`
  now emits 4 cylinders at `pos={x:±45, y:2.5, z:±25}, dims={r:3, h:7}`
  with NO rotation. Mathematically correct: centred in the plate's Y
  range, hole 2 mm longer than the plate so it pokes through cleanly.

---

## Iter-101.1 — Visual fidelity pass (2026-02-10)

**Why**: User reported the Pi 4 faceplate's cutouts read as inset
(centred ON the board edge → half each slot lived in the border)
and the bracket "looked like a B-2 bomber" because it was rendered
in print-flat pose viewed from above.

**Changes**:
- `voice_templates/boards.py` — cutout positions now shift OUTWARD
  by half the cutout's relevant dimension so the slot sits flush
  with the PLATE's outer edge (not the board's). Long-edge
  connectors shift in world Z; short-edge connectors shift in
  world X.
- `voice_templates/bracket.py` — bracket rebuilt in FUNCTIONAL
  pose (wall arm stands up along +Y, shelf arm lies flat extending
  along +X, gusset cube braces the inside corner). Visually reads
  as an L-bracket the moment it appears. Wall screw holes now
  cylinders rotated 90° around Z so their axes run horizontally
  through the wall arm. Shelf holes stay unrotated (cylinder
  default axis = world Y = vertical = through the shelf top).
  Users hit the existing **Lay Flat** button before slicing.
- `tests/test_voice_templates.py` — wall_arm dim assertions
  updated for the standing pose (`dims.z` is now wall height,
  `dims.x` is the plate thickness).

**Verified end-to-end (Playwright)**:
- Pi 4 → `95.0 × 3.0 × 66.0 mm` flat plate with cutouts FLUSH to
  the plate's outer perimeter (USB stack + GbE on the long edge,
  USB-C + dual µHDMI + audio on the short edge), four mount holes
  pierced cleanly at the corners.
- Bracket (6" / 1" / 30 lb) → `152.4 × 152.4 × 96.0 mm` in
  standing pose: wall arm rises vertically, shelf arm extends
  horizontally with 2 visible screw holes, gusset block at the
  inside angle. Single manifold positive, "Lay Flat" in one
  click before printing.
- `pytest backend/tests/test_voice_templates.py` — 14/14 green.

## Iter-101.2 — Backlog batch: delta auto-detect, new templates, voice discoverability (2026-02-10)

**Three backlog items knocked out in one pass.**

### 1. Auto-detect delta polygons in pasted OrcaSlicer JSON
- `frontend/src/lib/orcaProfiles.js::parseOrcaProfileJson` —
  heuristic added at the printable-area parse step: if the polygon
  has ≥ 8 vertices, the centroid-radii are tightly clustered
  (rmax/rmin < 1.10), AND the bbox is square-ish (≤ 5 % aspect
  diff), the parsed printer is tagged `kinematics: "delta"`. A
  friendly warning explains what was auto-detected. Hand-coded 4-
  corner cartesian rectangles fall straight through.

### 2. Second-wave templates
- `backend/voice_templates/drawer_pull.py` — flat-printed cabinet
  handle with two feet, a grip bar (oriented along world X via a
  90° Z rotation), hemispherical end caps, and screw clearance
  holes. Accepts imperial OR metric.
- `backend/voice_templates/tool_holder.py` — wall-mount rack with
  N evenly-spaced tool holes + 2 wall-mount screw holes. Tool
  diameter and count are the primary voice-extractable params.
- `backend/voice_templates/__init__.py` — both modules added to
  the `_TEMPLATE_MODULES` list (the only file that changes when
  registering a new template).
- Voice catalogue now: `board_faceplate`, `right_angle_bracket`,
  `drawer_pull`, `tool_holder` — 4 deterministic builders, all
  voice-triggerable.

### 3. Voice discoverability in HelpMegaMenu
- `frontend/src/components/toolbar/HelpMegaMenu.jsx` — new top
  section "WHAT VOICE CAN BUILD". Lazily fetches
  `/api/voice/templates` on first menu open, renders each
  template as a row with name, description, board catalogue (for
  the faceplate), and the first 6 param keys. Includes the
  "hold space → speak" hint inline. Tagged
  `data-testid="help-voice-template-<id>"`.

**Verified end-to-end**:
- `pytest backend/tests/test_voice_templates.py` — 14/14 green.
- `expand("drawer_pull", {length_mm:128, screw_spacing_mm:96})` →
  10 well-formed steps; `expand("tool_holder", {count:6,
  tool_diameter_mm:8})` → 11 well-formed steps.
- Playwright screenshot of HelpMegaMenu shows all 4 templates
  surfaced with their param hints; the faceplate row lists the
  10 supported boards.


## Iteration 105.15 (2026-06-24) — Sign-in timeout regression fix

**Problem reported by user**
- Clicking "Start Modeling" hung on a spinner for 2–3 minutes, then bounced to
  the sign-in gate. After completing Google OAuth, the round-trip failed with
  **"Sign-in failed: timeout of 20000ms exceeded"** — an unrecoverable dead
  end on the very first protected-route visit.

**Root cause**
- `authApi.exchange()` capped the `POST /api/auth/session` axios call at
  20 s. The backend's resilience retry loop against
  `demobackend.emergentagent.com/auth/v1/env/oauth/session-data` can
  legitimately run for up to ~25 s in the worst case (4 attempts × up to
  5 s upstream latency plus 5.4 s of exponential backoff between
  attempts). On a slow-upstream day the axios timeout fires before the
  backend's last retry has a chance to land.
- A secondary contributor: `authApi.me()` had **no** explicit timeout,
  so a one-off network blip on the bootstrap `/auth/me` call could pin
  the AuthProvider's `loading=true` state for minutes — which is exactly
  what painted the long orange-spinner screen the user described before
  the sign-in gate appeared.

**Fix**
- `frontend/src/lib/auth.js`:
  - `authApi.exchange()` timeout: `20000` → `45000` ms (comfortably above
    the backend's worst-case retry budget while still failing fast on a
    truly unreachable upstream).
  - `authApi.me()` timeout: added explicit `12000` ms (was unset → axios
    default of infinite). Failure now falls cleanly through to the
    sign-in gate instead of stalling the spinner.

**Verified**
- Clean backend restart confirmed the route now responds in ~5.6 s for
  an invalid session_id (matches the calculated 5.4 s of backoffs +
  4 fast upstream 404s).
- Landing page Playwright screenshot renders cleanly with the new
  bundle; no console regressions.


## Iteration 105.16 (2026-06-24) — Mesh repair: switch from MeshLab close_holes to PyMeshFix

**Problem reported by user**
- After iter-105.15 fixes shipped, `Repair Mesh` ran successfully on
  the hydrant (25 416 → 25 394 tris, "MeshLab 1.2 s"), but the STL
  Preview STILL showed **"1 BOOLEAN CUT WAS DROPPED — host mesh is
  non-manifold (open edges / self-intersections)"** when carving the
  filleted cube. MeshLab reported success while the output remained
  non-manifold.

**Root cause**
- MeshLab's `meshing_close_holes` only seals **closed boundary loops**.
  AI / photogrammetry meshes typically have hundreds of isolated open
  edges plus self-intersecting triangles. close_holes silently skips
  those, so the mesh stays non-manifold. The 22-triangle delta was
  just T-vertex removal — nothing got sealed.

**Fix — replace MeshLab close_holes with PyMeshFix**
- PyMeshFix (Marco Attene's MeshFix algorithm — the same library
  Slic3r / PrusaSlicer use internally for STL auto-repair) explicitly
  models surface topology, resolves self-intersections, fills every
  hole, and **guarantees a watertight 2-manifold output**.
- New pipeline (`/app/backend/routes/mesh_repair.py`):
    1. MeshLab — initial cleanup (merge close verts, dedupe faces /
       vertices, drop ≤4-tri shards, re-orient faces, T-vertex removal).
    2. **PyMeshFix** — `joincomp=True, remove_smallest_components=False`.
    3. **Trimesh** — verify `is_watertight` and `is_winding_consistent`,
       surface both as response headers.
- New response headers: `X-Repair-Input-Tris`,
  `X-Repair-Output-Tris`, `X-Repair-Watertight`,
  `X-Repair-Winding-Consistent`.
- Frontend toast now splits success vs warning based on watertight
  status so the user knows immediately whether the boolean will land.
- New deps: `pymeshfix==0.18.1`, `trimesh==4.11.5`, `scipy==1.17.1`,
  `networkx==3.6.1`, plus trimesh `[easy]` extras.
- Repair timeout bumped 30 s → 90 s.

**Verified end-to-end against the public preview URL**
- Watertight cube (12 tris) → 12 tris, watertight ✓.
- Holey cube (10 tris, top face missing) → 12 tris, watertight ✓ —
  PyMeshFix reconstructed the missing face.
- Broken icosphere (22 tris, 3 missing faces + 5 self-intersecting
  tris) → 4-tri minimal watertight shell, `is_volume=True`.

## Iteration 105.17 (2026-06-24) — 3MF modifier-mesh export (Option A from HYDRANT_EXPORT_PLAN)

**Decision**
The user pivoted from chasing ever-more-aggressive backend repair toward
the path the spec called Option A — emit a 3MF that carries the host AND
each negative as separate **volumes**, and let the downstream slicer
(PrusaSlicer / OrcaSlicer / Bambu Studio / SuperSlicer) do the boolean at
slice time using its own (much more robust) CSG. This sidesteps the
"host mesh is non-manifold → boolean dropped" problem entirely on the
ForgeSlicer side.

**Implementation — frontend only, zero backend changes**
- `lib/threemf.js`:
  - Added `build3MFBytesWithModifiers({ positiveVolumes, negativeVolumes, projectName })`.
  - All volumes' triangles concatenated into a single `<mesh>` inside one `<object>`.
  - Sidecar `Metadata/Slic3r_PE_model.config` partitions the triangle
    range and tags each volume's `volume_type` as `ModelPart` or
    `ModelNegativeVolume` (Slic3r/PrusaSlicer/Orca extension).
- `lib/exporters.js`:
  - Added `bakeObjectToWorldGeometry(obj, sceneObjects)` — bakes the
    object's local geometry into world-space without touching any
    Three.js scene graph (pure value-in, value-out).
  - Added `exportSceneToModifier3MFBytes(objects, projectName)` — bakes
    every visible object, drops the assembly to z=0, and hands off to
    `build3MFBytesWithModifiers`. Returns `{ bytes, triangleCount,
    parts, positiveCount, negativeCount }`.
- `lib/workerClient.js`:
  - Added `export3MFModifierBytesAsync(objects, projectName)` — async
    wrapper for the orchestrator above.
  - Updated `export3MFBytesAsync` to **auto-route** to the modifier-mesh
    path when the scene contains BOTH a visible imported positive AND a
    visible negative. Native primitives (cube/sphere/cylinder/etc.)
    are always manifold so projects without imports keep the old
    merged-single-mesh output the slicer prefers.
- `components/STLPreviewDialog.jsx`:
  - The amber "Boolean cut was dropped" banner now offers a one-click
    "Download 3MF with Modifiers" button that calls
    `export3MFModifierBytesAsync` and downloads `<project>.modifier.3mf`.
  - Updated copy: the recommended fix is now to download a 3MF with
    modifier meshes (instead of "click Repair Mesh and reopen"),
    since modifier-mesh export works even when the host can't be
    made watertight.

**Manual validation (Node.js, ahead of testing-agent run)**
- Built a synthetic 3MF with a 12-tri positive cube + 12-tri negative
  cube; unzipped via JSZip; verified `Metadata/Slic3r_PE_model.config`
  contains: `volume firstid=0 lastid=11 → ModelPart`,
  `volume firstid=12 lastid=23 → ModelNegativeVolume`, and the
  triangle counts add up. Bundle smoke check confirmed the live JS
  bundle contains `build3MFBytesWithModifiers`, `ModelNegativeVolume`,
  `Slic3r_PE_model.config`, and `export3MFModifierBytesAsync`.

**Files touched**
- `lib/threemf.js` — new builder + helpers (escapeXml, packageModifierZip).
- `lib/exporters.js` — new `bakeObjectToWorldGeometry` + `exportSceneToModifier3MFBytes`.
- `lib/workerClient.js` — auto-routing in `export3MFBytesAsync`, new `export3MFModifierBytesAsync`.
- `components/STLPreviewDialog.jsx` — new button + updated copy.

**Net effect for the user**
For the hydrant project, opening the Send-to-Slicer hand-off now produces
a 3MF that loads in OrcaSlicer with the host and all negatives already
attached as modifier volumes — no manual repair step required, no manual
modifier reattachment in the slicer's outliner, the carve "just works"
at slice time. The Repair Mesh path remains available for users who
need a single-mesh STL output.


## Iteration 105.18 (2026-06-24) — Modifier-mesh 3MF schema fix for OrcaSlicer

**Problem reported by user**
- The 3MF emitted by iter-105.17 was opened in OrcaSlicer (FlashForge
  AD5X profile). The slicer loaded the geometry but treated the cube
  negative as a positive protrusion sticking out the side of the
  hydrant. Object info pane: "Object_1 — Triangles: 32 973 —
  Error: 1 493 non-manifold edges". The modifier metadata was being
  ignored.

**Root cause**
- iter-105.17 wrote the modifier sidecar only as
  `Metadata/Slic3r_PE_model.config` (the PrusaSlicer name).
  OrcaSlicer / BambuStudio look for `Metadata/model_settings.config`
  (the BBS_MODEL_CONFIG_FILE constant in upstream
  `src/libslic3r/Format/bbs_3mf.cpp`). Without the BBS filename the
  slicer falls back to treating the file as a generic 3MF —
  geometry loads, modifier metadata is dropped on the floor.

**Fix — schema brought up to BBS / Slic3r-PE compliance**
- `lib/threemf.js > packageModifierZip` now writes the sidecar under
  **BOTH** filenames (`Metadata/model_settings.config` AND
  `Metadata/Slic3r_PE_model.config`) with identical XML payload.
- `[Content_Types].xml` now declares the `.config` extension so
  package validators don't drop the sidecars as unknown payload.
- Empty `3D/_rels/3dmodel.model.rels` added (some validators reject
  a 3MF that doesn't have a per-model rels stub).
- The `<model>` element now carries the BBS production namespace
  (`xmlns:p`), the Slic3r-PE namespace (`xmlns:slic3rpe`), and the
  BambuStudio namespace (`xmlns:BambuStudio`), plus two version
  markers (`BambuStudio:3mfVersion=1`, `slic3rpe:Version3mf=1`)
  that signal "this is a project-format 3MF, look at the sidecar".
- The `<object>` carries `p:UUID`, the `<build>` carries `p:UUID`,
  and the build `<item>` carries the column-major 4×3 identity
  `transform` attribute — all conventions from the BBS source.
- Each `<volume>` in the config now carries the full BBS schema
  (name, volume_type, matrix, source_file, source_object_id,
  source_volume_id, source_offset_{x,y,z}). The object also carries
  an `extruder=1` metadata row.

**Verified by testing_agent_v3_fork** (`/app/test_reports/iteration_96.json`)
- 100% pass on every assertion: zip file list, byte-identity of the
  two sidecars, namespace presence, version markers, p:UUIDs,
  transform, per-volume schema completeness, single
  `ModelNegativeVolume` occurrence for a 1-positive + 1-negative
  scene. Live bundle smoke confirmed all new strings shipped.

**Files touched**
- `lib/threemf.js` — modifier model XML rewritten with BBS schema +
  packageModifierZip writes both filenames + .config Content-Type +
  per-model rels stub.


## Iteration 105.19 (2026-06-24) — Modifier-mesh 3MF: switch to OrcaSlicer's NATIVE multi-object schema

**Problem reported by user (frustrated, 1200 credits spent)**
- Even after iter-105.18 (which wrote the sidecar under BOTH
  `model_settings.config` AND `Slic3r_PE_model.config`), OrcaSlicer
  STILL loaded the modifier 3MF as a single merged Object_1 with
  32 973 triangles and the cube negative appeared as a positive
  protrusion off the hydrant body. The slicer empirically ignored
  the legacy PrusaSlicer-style triangle-range modifier metadata.

**Root cause**
- iter-105.17/18 used PrusaSlicer-legacy schema: ONE merged `<mesh>`
  inside ONE `<object>`, plus a `Metadata/model_settings.config`
  sidecar with `<volume firstid lastid volume_type=ModelNegativeVolume>`
  blocks partitioning the triangle range. OrcaSlicer's modern BBS
  parser doesn't apply that schema reliably — the user's slicer
  shipped a single blob.

**Fix — OrcaSlicer's NATIVE multi-object schema**
- Each volume is now its OWN `<object>` in `<resources>` with its OWN
  `<mesh>`. A parent assembly `<object id=1>` references them via
  `<components>`. Modifier role is declared per sub-object as
  `<part id=N subtype="normal_part|negative_part">` inside
  `Metadata/model_settings.config` (still written under both
  filenames for PrusaSlicer compat).
- This is what saving a project natively in OrcaSlicer / Bambu Studio
  produces, so it's as compatible as humanly possible.
- **SAFETY NET**: even if a slicer build fails to parse the sidecar
  entirely (older OrcaSlicer build, exotic fork, etc.), the user
  STILL sees TWO distinct objects in the slicer outliner and can
  right-click → "Change type → Negative volume" to flip the cube
  manually. The previous iter's single-mesh approach had NO such
  fallback — everything looked like one merged blob.

**Verified by testing_agent_v3_fork** (`/app/test_reports/iteration_97.json`)
- 37/37 fixture assertions pass on the new `_buildVolumeObjectXml` /
  `_uuidFor` helpers and the full multi-object output.
- 9/9 bundle markers present (`negative_part`, `normal_part`,
  `<components>`, `subtype=`, `<component objectid`,
  `_buildVolumeObjectXml`, `_uuidFor`, `BambuStudio:3mfVersion`,
  both sidecar filenames).
- Old `<volume firstid…>` / `lastid=` triangle-range schema
  COMPLETELY ABSENT from both the shipped bundle and the generated
  file — no risk of accidentally falling back to the broken format.
- Reference fixture at `/tmp/iter105_19.modifier.3mf` (7822 bytes).
- UI smoke OK.

**Files touched**
- `lib/threemf.js` — `build3MFBytesWithModifiers` fully rewritten;
  new helpers `_buildVolumeObjectXml(objectId, geometry)` and
  `_uuidFor(objectId)`. Legacy triangle-range path removed.


## Iteration 105.20 (2026-06-24) — Remove fillet/chamfer Inspector controls

**User request**
- "Remove the chamfering and fillet options from the Inspect screen as
  they are misleading."

**Why misleading**
- The modifier-mesh 3MF export pipeline (iter-105.19 BBS multi-object
  schema) doesn't propagate per-edge fillet/chamfer geometry through
  to the slicer's modifier-volume carve. Users would dial in a fillet,
  export, then find the slicer carved with sharp edges anyway because
  the slicer parses the cube as a separate negative volume and
  ignores the parametric edge metadata we attached to it.

**Change**
- Deleted all three `<EdgeControls>` JSX usages from
  `/app/frontend/src/components/RightPanel.jsx` (cube, cylinder, cone
  Inspector blocks) plus the import. Comment blocks at lines 11, 833,
  and ~923 document the deliberate removal with rationale and point
  to `inspector/EdgeControls.jsx` for future restoration.
- The component file itself is **preserved on disk** — if the slicer
  pipeline ever honours per-edge geometry through the modifier carve
  (Bambu future versions are heading this way), it can be restored
  with a one-line import + three one-line JSX inserts.
- Webpack tree-shook the dead module from the shipped bundle
  (verified — all 5 testids absent from `bundle.js`).

**Verified by testing_agent_v3_fork** (`/app/test_reports/iteration_98.json`) — 100% pass:
- 5/5 bundle removal markers (`edge-controls`, `edge-style-fillet`,
  `edge-style-chamfer`, `edge-radius-slider`, `edge-mode-picker` all
  return 0 hits in the shipped bundle).
- 7/7 iter-105.19 multi-object 3MF markers preserved at exact same
  hit counts as the iteration_97.json baseline — no regression.
- 4/4 primitive Inspector probes (cube / cylinder / cone / sphere)
  confirm zero edge-controls DOM presence; `dim-x/y/z`, `dim-segments`,
  Transforms, etc. still render correctly.
- Screenshot at `/app/test_reports/iter105_20_cube_inspector.png`
  shows the full Cube Inspector minus the edge panel.


## Iteration 105.21 (2026-06-24) — Drop Bambu Lab vendor marker from modifier-mesh 3MF

**User request**
- "When it opens up the slicer on export, it is always saying it is
  missing a Bambu library. I don't have any Bambu printers; are there
  better settings other than the Bambu ones?"
- "I use Sovol and Elegoo printers too; so, don't build me into a
  corner."

**Root cause**
- The iter-105.17 → 105.19 modifier-mesh 3MF declared
  `xmlns:BambuStudio="http://schemas.bambulab.com/package/2021"` and
  `<metadata name="BambuStudio:3mfVersion">1</metadata>` in
  `3D/3dmodel.model`. Both markers cue OrcaSlicer to try to resolve a
  Bambu Lab printer-profile bundle on open. User runs FlashForge AD5X
  / Sovol / Elegoo (no Bambu profile installed) → "missing a Bambu
  library" warning.

**Fix — surgical removal of vendor markers**
- `/app/frontend/src/lib/threemf.js > build3MFBytesWithModifiers` —
  removed both Bambu strings from the emitted `3D/3dmodel.model`.
  Kept the generic Slic3r-PE marker (`xmlns:slic3rpe` +
  `slic3rpe:Version3mf=1`) so OrcaSlicer / PrusaSlicer / SuperSlicer
  still recognise the file as a "Slic3r-derivative project" — but
  WITHOUT triggering vendor-library lookups.
- Multi-object schema from iter-105.19 fully preserved:
  `<components>` + per-volume `<object>` + `<part subtype="negative_part">`
  in the `model_settings.config` sidecar.
- Cura-derivatives (Sovol Cura, Elegoo Cura, FlashPrint) ignore the
  Slic3r-PE sidecar but still import each `<object>` as a separate
  mesh the user can manually flag via right-click → Per Model
  Settings → "Cutting Mesh". The schema is fully spec-compliant 3MF.

**Verified by testing_agent_v3_fork** (`/app/test_reports/iteration_99.json`) — 100% pass:
- 23/23 fixture invariants on the emitted XML.
- Bundle smoke: `xmlns:BambuStudio=0`, `BambuStudio:3mfVersion=0`
  (Bambu markers gone). All iter-105.19 schema markers preserved at
  exact baseline counts.
- iter-105.20 edge-controls removal still in effect (0 hits on all
  five testids).
- Workspace UI renders correctly authenticated.

**Files touched**
- `lib/threemf.js` — model.model XML template (lines 145-167) drops
  `xmlns:BambuStudio` + `BambuStudio:3mfVersion` metadata row.


## Iteration 105.23 (2026-06-26) — Slicer auto-handoff (`open/?file=<URL>`)

**User request**
- "When it loads the Slicer, you then have to manually go to 'Open
  Project' to load the 3MF file." Previously Send-to-Slicer launched
  the slicer via bare `orcaslicer://` (no file arg) → slicer opened
  with an empty workspace, user had to drag/open the downloaded file
  by hand.

**Fix — new backend route + frontend handoff plumbing**

BACKEND (new file `/app/backend/routes/exports.py`):
- `POST /api/exports/handoff?filename=<name>` — auth-required (session
  cookie OR `Authorization: Bearer`), accepts raw `application/octet-stream`
  body, stores in GridFS bucket `export_handoff_files`. Returns
  `{token, url, filename, expires_at, size}`. Token = 128-bit hex,
  single-shot, 30-min TTL.
- `GET /api/exports/handoff/{token}` — PUBLIC (no auth — slicer can't
  forward browser cookies). Streams the file back with
  `Content-Disposition: attachment`. Deletes the index record BEFORE
  streaming (so concurrent / subsequent GETs see 404), schedules
  GridFS chunk cleanup via `BackgroundTasks`. 410 Gone for expired.
- Passive `_purge_expired` sweep on every POST.
- Router mounted in `server.py` alongside `mesh_repair`.

FRONTEND (`/app/frontend/src/lib/customSlicers.js`):
- New `stageHandoff(bytes, filename)` — POSTs to `/api/exports/handoff`.
- `launchSlicer(protocol, {fileUrl})` now constructs
  `<protocol>open/?file=<URL-encoded URL>` for Slic3r-family
  protocols (orcaslicer / prusaslicer / superslicer / bambustudioopen).
  Cura-family + unknowns fall back to bare-protocol launch.

FRONTEND (`/app/frontend/src/components/dialogs/OrcaDialog.jsx > handleDownload`):
- Still downloads local copy (backup for Cura users + handoff-failure
  fallback).
- Now ALSO stages bytes → gets public URL → passes to `launchSlicer`.
- Graceful fallback toast if staging fails.

**Verified by testing_agent_v3_fork** (`/app/test_reports/iteration_101.json`) — 17/17 pytest cases + 1 race test PASS:
- Happy path: stage → 200 + token + URL + size; GET via token → 200 +
  byte-identical body + correct headers.
- Auth: POST without bearer → 401. Empty body → 400. 60 MB body → 413.
- Single-shot: 2nd GET → 404. 5-way concurrent race → exactly 1×200 +
  4×404 (delete-before-stream is atomic via Mongo `delete_one`).
- Expired: 410 Gone + GridFS purge confirmed.
- Bundle smoke: all four new code-path strings shipped.
- Regression: iter-105.19 / .20 / .21 markers all intact.

**Test artefact**: `/app/backend/tests/test_exports_handoff.py` (17 tests, canonical regression).


## Iteration 105.24 (2026-06-26) — Honest "manual-open" path for Cura + Flash Studio

**User report**
- "Loads OrcaSlicer and displays the model. Does not open Flash Studio
  or Cura." (Iter-105.23's auto-handoff worked for OrcaSlicer.)

**Root cause**
- Neither Ultimaker (Cura) nor FlashForge (Flash Studio Desktop)
  register an OS URL-protocol handler for `cura://` or `flashforge://`.
  iter-105.23's `launchSlicer()` blindly set `window.location.href` to
  those non-existent protocols — browser fired the protocol, OS had
  no handler, nothing happened. User sees "did nothing".

**Fix — frontend only, no backend changes**

1. `lib/customSlicers.js > BUILTIN_SLICERS`: added
   `noProtocolLauncher: true` to the `flashstudio` and `cura` entries
   (source of truth for "can't auto-launch via browser").
2. `dialogs/OrcaDialog.jsx > handleDownload`: short-circuits when
   `slicer.noProtocolLauncher === true`. Skips both the
   `stageHandoff` upload AND the `launchSlicer` call entirely. Sets
   `launchState='manual_only'` and surfaces a 12-second `toast.info`
   explaining how to open the file manually.
3. New sky-blue UI card (`data-testid="orca-launch-manual-only"`)
   mirrors the existing uncertain-card UX (filename code box +
   copy-filename button + default-app tip) but with honest copy
   that doesn't blame the user for misconfiguration.
4. Dialog description above the Download button now reads
   "<Slicer> doesn't support browser auto-launch — you'll open the
   file manually" (instead of the misleading "tries to launch via
   `<protocol>://` handler" copy that the user definitely was NOT
   going to see succeed).

**Verified by testing_agent_v3_fork** (`/app/test_reports/iteration_102.json`) — 6/6 review items PASS:
- Playwright on the live preview URL drove the full Send-to-Slicer
  flow for all four target slicers (Cura, Flash Studio, OrcaSlicer,
  PrusaSlicer).
- Cura + Flash Studio: download triggers, `orca-launch-manual-only`
  card visible, `orca-launch-uncertain`/`-likely` NOT visible,
  ZERO POSTs to `/api/exports/handoff` (staging correctly skipped —
  saves bandwidth too).
- OrcaSlicer + PrusaSlicer regression: download + `orca-launch-uncertain`
  card + exactly 1 POST to `/api/exports/handoff` per launch — iter-
  105.23 happy path intact.
- BUILTIN_SLICERS unit (Node import): 9/9 — exactly 7 builtins,
  Cura/FlashStudio have the flag, the other 5 don't.

**Files touched**
- `lib/customSlicers.js` — 2 entries flagged.
- `components/dialogs/OrcaDialog.jsx` — handleDownload short-circuit,
  conditional description copy, new manual_only card.



## Iteration 105.25 (2026-06-26) — RANSAC primitive segmentation (Phase 1: planes)

### Why
First slice of the Shapr3D-style "Reverse Engineer" feature on the
P1 backlog. Goal: turn an imported mechanical-part STL into a list
of editable parametric primitives (planes, cylinders, spheres,
cones) so the user can modify the part rather than being stuck with
an immutable triangle soup. Phase 1 ships plane detection only —
just enough to validate the backend pipeline end-to-end before
extending to curved surfaces in Phase 2.

### What landed (backend only)
- **New `POST /api/mesh/segment` route** (`routes/mesh_segment.py`):
  accepts raw STL bytes (`application/octet-stream`, same Cloudflare
  WAF-bypass pattern as `/api/mesh/repair`), returns JSON describing
  every detected plane with normal, offset, inlier count + fraction,
  centroid, and bbox. Auth-gated like the rest of the mesh routes.
- **Iterative RANSAC loop**: detects the largest planar region using
  `pyransac3d` (pure-Python, 18 KB dep), removes its inliers, repeats
  until the next plane would account for < 2% of remaining points or
  the per-iteration min-inlier count (50) isn't met. Hard cap at 24
  primitives so a noisy mesh can't produce dozens of micro-planes.
- **Surface sampling, not centroid sampling**: `trimesh.sample_surface`
  generates ~8k uniformly-distributed surface points. Centroid
  sampling on low-poly meshes (e.g. a 12-tri cube) collapses the
  cloud enough that RANSAC fits *diagonal* planes through face
  midpoints — surface sampling drowns out those false positives.
- **Sliver + aspect-ratio filter**: after each fit, project inliers
  onto the candidate plane, measure in-plane extents (u, v). Reject
  if either extent is below 5% of bbox-diagonal OR if the u:v aspect
  ratio exceeds 8:1. This drops cylinder side-wall strips that
  RANSAC would otherwise hallucinate as a parade of tiny planes.
  The aspect threshold is the key parameter — too tight rejects long
  brackets, too loose lets curved-strip slivers through.
- **Mesh-scale-relative epsilon**: default `eps_frac=0.002` of bbox
  diagonal (overridable via `?eps_frac=` query param, clamped to
  [0.0001, 0.05]). The same absolute tolerance that works on a 5 mm
  bracket is useless on a 500 mm enclosure.
- **Process-pool isolation**: 60s timeout, 50 MB upload cap, two
  workers — mirrors the `/api/mesh/repair` plumbing so a slow segment
  can't pin the main event loop.

### Test coverage (`/app/backend/tests/`)
- `test_segment_cube.py`: 20mm cube → expects 6 planes, 100% coverage.
  PASSES.
- `test_segment_edges.py`: smoke battery —
  - Sphere (icosphere subdiv 3) → 0 planes, 0% coverage. Correctly
    identifies organic shape with no flat regions (this signal will
    power the "Phase 3 honest warning" — if coverage < 30% after
    full segmentation, the mesh is organic/sculptural and the
    Reverse-Engineer button should flash a "this won't work well for
    art pieces" message rather than running silently).
  - Cylinder (radius 10, height 30, 64 sections) → 8 planes (2 caps
    + 6 surviving side-wall strips). Phase 2 will collapse the
    strips by detecting the cylinder *first*.
  - L-bracket (boolean union of two boxes) → 8 planes, 100%
    coverage. The textbook mechanical-part case works beautifully.

### Why this is the right architecture
RANSAC is iterative and numpy-heavy. Pure-JS implementations exist
but would be 5-10× slower than the Python build. A WASM port of
CGAL or Open3D would ship 2-3 MB to every page load. With the
backend already running `pymeshfix` + `trimesh` for `/api/mesh/repair`,
adding `pyransac3d` alongside is an 18 KB pip dep that reuses the
existing process-pool plumbing and stream-upload pattern.

### Files touched
- `backend/routes/mesh_segment.py` — new (245 lines).
- `backend/server.py` — import + `api_router.include_router(...)`.
- `backend/requirements.txt` — `pyransac3d==0.6.0`.
- `backend/tests/test_segment_cube.py` — new.
- `backend/tests/test_segment_edges.py` — new.

### Up next
- **Phase 2**: extend the iterative loop to cylinders / spheres /
  cones BEFORE planes (so caps don't get detected first and strip
  out the data needed to fit the curved primitive). Will likely
  reduce the cylinder test's plane count from 8 → 2.
- **Phase 3**: frontend "Reverse Engineer" button + primitive panel.
  Honest warning when coverage < 30% ("this looks like an art piece
  — primitives won't reconstruct it well"). Color-coded inlier
  overlay on the original mesh.
- **Phase 4**: "Replace with Primitives" — swap the static mesh for
  editable Three.js parametric objects.


## Iteration 105.26 (2026-06-26) — RANSAC primitive segmentation (Phase 2: cylinders + spheres before planes)

### Why
Phase 1 detected planes only. Phase 2 extends the iterative detector
to spheres and cylinders BEFORE planes, so curved surfaces don't get
fragmented into N narrow planar strips. The cylinder test went from
"8 planes (Phase 1)" to "1 cylinder + 2 caps (Phase 2)" — the
explicit success criterion the user set.

### What landed (backend only)
- **Pipeline order: sphere → cylinder → plane.** Curved primitives
  detect first; what's left feeds the plane stage as the catch-all.
- **Sphere detector** (`_detect_spheres`): pyransac3d Sphere fit on a
  1500-point subsample, then re-classify inliers against the full
  remaining cloud. Validates by:
  - **Radius / bbox check** — rejects NaN, negative, or oversize fits.
  - **3-axis extent check** — smallest inlier-bbox extent must be
    ≥ 0.4 r (rejects flat-disc / great-circle phantom fits).
  - **Polar-angle histogram** — inlier latitudes must populate ≥ 5
    of 10 bins (rejects two-ring "sphere through cylinder caps"
    phantoms).
  - **Surface-normal radial alignment** — inlier normals must point
    radially from / to the candidate center (|n · radial_unit| ≥ 0.9).
    Single signal that defeats every "inscribed sphere through cube
    face-rings" phantom fit on flat-faced meshes.
- **Cylinder detector** — went through three iterations to get right:
  1. **First cut (pyransac3d Cylinder.fit)** rejected. pyransac3d's
     cylinder fit consistently returns a tilted axis (off by ~0.1
     perpendicular components) and inlier counts way below the true
     value (4-5%). Even with 2500 iterations the axis didn't
     converge to the true direction.
  2. **PCA-on-inliers refinement** rejected. PCA on a sparse spiral
     of true-cylinder points returns roughly the spiral's direction,
     not the cylinder axis. Couldn't escape the tilted starting axis.
  3. **Normal-driven Hough + 2D Kasa circle fit** (`_cylinder_axis_candidates`,
     `_fit_cylinder_from_axis`, `_ransac_2d_circles`). The shipped
     implementation:
     - **Hough vote on the Gauss map**: score each candidate axis
       direction by `(angular bins populated by perpendicular face
       normals) × (perpendicular face count)`. Real cylinder axes
       score 4× higher than random directions because cylinder side
       normals trace a great circle.
     - **2D RANSAC** on candidate-perpendicular points projected to
       the perpendicular plane. Picks 3 random points → circumcircle
       → counts inliers. Iterates 400× per axis. Then refines via
       Kasa algebraic circle fit on the inliers.
     - **Multi-circle**: returns up to 3 distinct circles per axis,
       so a part with an outer cylinder and an inner bore on the
       same axis comes back as 2 primitives.
- **Cylinder validation gates** (in order, cheap-first):
  - `height ≥ 0.4 r` (rejects curved-cap fits).
  - `max axial gap / height < 0.35` (rejects 2-cluster phantom fits
    on cap rims at z = ±h/2).
  - `arc coverage ≥ 90°` (rejects too-narrow arcs).
  - `position angular bins ≥ 9 / 18` (rejects phantom fits whose
    inliers cluster at only a few positions).
  - `radial residual std-dev ≤ 0.6 eps` (tight shell).
  - `mean |normal · radial_unit| ≥ 0.85` (radial-aligned normals).
  - **`normal-direction bins ≥ 12 / 18`** (the killer) — the
    inliers' surface normal directions must sweep at least 2/3 of
    the perpendicular circle. Real cylinder side walls have 18/18;
    phantom fits on flat-faced meshes (cube → 4-strip inscribed
    circle; L-bracket → 8 face normals) max out at 9. Threshold 12
    keeps a 3-bin margin from the worst phantoms while easily
    admitting real cylinders.
- **Deterministic RNG seeding** (`np.random.seed(hash(stl))`):
  pyransac3d uses `np.random` globally without honouring a custom
  Generator. Seeding from the STL hash makes results reproducible
  across calls and independent of earlier RNG consumption (so a
  cube test followed by a cylinder test always returns the same
  result; previously order-dependent).
- **Legacy pyransac3d-based `_detect_cylinders`** kept in the
  module but unwired — preserved for future fallback experiments
  on low-poly / no-normals meshes.

### Test coverage (`/app/backend/tests/test_segment_phase2.py`)
| Shape | tris | primitives | coverage | wall |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Cube 20³ | 12 | 6 planes | 100% | 1.0 s |
| Sphere r=20 | 1280 | 1 sphere | 100% | 0.06 s |
| Cylinder r=10 h=30 | 256 | 1 cyl + 2 planes | 100% | 1.5 s |
| L-bracket (2-box union) | 24 | 8 planes | 100% | 1.0 s |
| Block 40×40×20 + Ø16 through-hole | 272 | 1 cyl + 6 planes | 100% | 2.5 s |

The block-with-hole result is the most important one: pyransac3d-only
detection misses holes < 20% of the cloud (RANSAC iteration count
needed grows ∝ 1/cluster⁵). The normal-driven Hough finds them
deterministically.

### Files touched
- `backend/routes/mesh_segment.py` — added `_cylinder_axis_candidates`,
  `_fit_cylinder_from_axis`, `_ransac_2d_circles`,
  `_detect_cylinders_via_normals`, `_detect_spheres`, `_refine_cylinder`,
  `_sphere_inliers`, `_cylinder_inliers`. Refactored `_segment_stl_sync`
  to sphere → cylinder → plane stages. ~1240 lines total.
- `backend/tests/test_segment_phase2.py` — new (the 5-shape battery).
- `backend/tests/test_segment_edges.py` — updated sphere assertion
  (Phase 2 now detects the sphere primitive; previously 0 planes,
  now 100% coverage as a sphere).

### Up next
- **Phase 3**: frontend "Reverse Engineer" button + primitive panel.
  Honest "this looks like an art piece" warning when `stats.coverage`
  < 30% (the `coverage` field already carries this signal). Color-
  coded inlier overlay on the original mesh.
- **Phase 4**: "Replace with Primitives" — swap the static mesh for
  editable Three.js parametric Box / Cylinder / Sphere objects.

### Known limitations
- **No cone detector yet**. Deferred to a Phase 2.5: pyransac3d has
  no Cone class so we'd need a custom RANSAC. Affects screw heads
  and chamfered features — important for hardware but not for
  generic CAD parts.
- **Tilted-axis cylinders** (oblique to canonical axes) detection
  depends on the Hough sampling's 240 random directions covering
  the true axis. For most CAD parts the axis is canonical (X/Y/Z)
  which we include as fixed samples. A pathologically-tilted
  cylinder (e.g., axis at 47.3° to everything) is still handled
  via the random samples but with a ~1° angular resolution. Tighten
  if user feedback says it's missing oblique cylinders.


## Iteration 105.27 (2026-06-26) — RANSAC primitive segmentation (Phase 3: frontend Reverse-Engineer dialog) + sphere-dedup fix

### Why
Phase 3 of the Shapr3D-style reverse engineering feature. Phase 1
shipped backend plane detection; Phase 2 added curved primitives;
Phase 3 surfaces the results to the user via a new "Reverse Engineer"
button on imported meshes. User explicitly requested an honest
"this looks like an art piece" warning when the mesh isn't suitable
for primitive reconstruction — implemented as a coverage-threshold
banner inside the dialog.

### What landed
- **New `lib/meshSegmentApi.js`** (frontend) — wraps `/api/mesh/segment`
  the same way `meshRepairApi.js` wraps `/api/mesh/repair`: raw
  `application/octet-stream` POST of binary STL bytes (Cloudflare WAF
  bypass), returns the JSON primitive list. Exports:
  - `segmentMeshOnServer(stlBytes, { epsFrac })` — low-level wire call.
  - `segmentImportedObject(obj)` — high-level helper that pulls the
    geometry out of a Zustand `imported` scene object, exports it via
    `geometryToSTLBinary`, and hits the endpoint.
  - `classifyMeshShape(coverage)` — heuristic: `mechanical` (≥ 80%),
    `mixed` (30–80%), `organic` (< 30%). Drives the banner.
- **New `components/dialogs/ReverseEngineerDialog.jsx`** — modal that
  fires on click of the new "Reverse Engineer" button. Layout:
  - Sparkles + title header.
  - Loading state while POSTing.
  - **Honest-warning banner** when `classification === "organic"`
    (coverage < 30%) — amber AlertTriangle: "This looks like an art
    piece. Only X% of the mesh fits geometric primitives — sculptures,
    organic forms, and freeform CAD won't reconstruct cleanly. The
    detected primitives below are a best-effort approximation, not an
    accurate parametric model. Reverse-Engineering works best on
    mechanical parts."
  - **Mixed-coverage banner** for the 30–80% range — softer sky-blue
    "review carefully" callout.
  - 4-tile stats grid: Planes / Cylinders / Spheres / Coverage. The
    coverage tile turns amber when organic, lime when mechanical.
  - Scrollable primitive list — one row per detected primitive with
    type icon (orange Square, blue Cylinder, emerald Circle), inlier
    count + %, and the type-specific params (plane normal+d / sphere
    center+r / cylinder center+axis+r+h+arc).
  - Footer with raw stats: tri count, ε, wall time.
  - "Phase 4 will add &apos;Replace with Primitives&apos; — for now
    this is inspection-only" hint at the bottom.
  - data-testids on every interactive / informational element for
    testing-agent driving.
- **Inspector wiring** (`components/RightPanel.jsx`):
  - New `reverseEngineerOpen` useState (hooks-order-stable, declared
    next to the existing `repairBusy`).
  - "Reverse Engineer" button added under the existing "Repair Mesh"
    block on imported objects, indigo styling with Sparkles icon,
    tooltip explaining when to use it. `data-testid="reverse-engineer-btn"`.
  - Dialog mounted at the Inspector root so it overlays the entire
    workspace (not just the right panel).

### Bug fixed alongside (regression in iter-105.26 sphere detector)
- **Sphere dedup check.** Repeated RANSAC passes on a low-poly
  icosphere were re-detecting the same sphere 2-3× because the first
  fit's residual points STILL formed a roughly-spherical shell. Added
  a "is this new sphere within 10% center distance + 10% radius of
  an already-recorded one?" check — if so, mark its inliers consumed
  but don't record the duplicate. `_segment_stl_sync` on an
  icosphere (subdivisions=2, r=20) now returns 1 sphere @ 99.9%
  coverage instead of 2-3 phantom dupes.

### Test coverage
- Phase 2 backend tests still pass (`test_segment_phase2.py`):
  - Cube: 6 planes
  - Sphere: 1 sphere (with dedup, was 1-3)
  - Cylinder: 1 cyl + 2 caps
  - L-bracket: 8 planes
  - Block with through-hole: 1 cyl + 6 planes
- Frontend end-to-end verified via playwright on the preview env:
  - Cube STL injected → button visible → dialog opens → loading →
    "6 Planes 0 Cylinders 0 Spheres 100% Coverage" + 6 rows. No
    organic warning (correctly hidden — coverage = 100%).
  - All data-testids present and queryable.
- Full preview-env wire test confirmed (`POST /api/mesh/segment` with
  cube STL via session cookie returns the expected payload).

### Files touched
- `frontend/src/lib/meshSegmentApi.js` — new (~95 lines).
- `frontend/src/components/dialogs/ReverseEngineerDialog.jsx` — new (~315 lines).
- `frontend/src/components/RightPanel.jsx` — added import, `reverseEngineerOpen`
  state, the button, and the dialog mount at the bottom.
- `backend/routes/mesh_segment.py` — sphere dedup check in `_detect_spheres`.

### Up next
- **Phase 4** — "Replace with Primitives" action. The dialog currently
  is read-only; Phase 4 will swap the imported triangle mesh for
  editable Three.js Box / Cylinder / Sphere objects positioned at the
  detected transforms. Will involve a Zustand action that takes the
  primitive list and instantiates parametric objects.
- **Phase 2.5 (deferred)** — Cone detection (requires custom RANSAC).


## Iteration 105.28 (2026-06-26) — Branding & SEO metadata cleanup

### Why
The deployed shell still carried the boilerplate Emergent template
metadata: `<title>Emergent | Fullstack App</title>`, a placeholder
"A product of emergent.sh" description, no Open Graph / Twitter
card tags, no favicon, no manifest. Search engines and social-card
previews surfaced the template branding instead of ForgeSlicer.

### What landed
- **`public/index.html` rewritten** with a complete metadata block:
  - `<title>` → **"ForgeSlicer — Browser CAD & 3D Printing Design Tool"**
  - Long-form `<meta name="description">` describing primitives,
    Booleans, AI mesh generation, and the OrcaSlicer / Bambu / Prusa
    handoff.
  - `application-name`, `author`, `keywords` for legacy crawlers.
  - `<link rel="canonical">` pointing at `https://forgeslicer.com/`.
  - **Open Graph block** (`og:type=website`, `og:site_name=ForgeSlicer`,
    `og:url`, `og:title`, `og:description`, `og:image` →
    `forgeslicer-logo.webp`, `og:image:alt`).
  - **Twitter card block** (`twitter:card=summary_large_image`,
    `twitter:title`, `twitter:description`, `twitter:image`,
    `twitter:image:alt`).
  - **Favicon + Apple touch icons** all pointing at the existing
    `/forgeslicer-logo.webp` asset (multi-size `apple-touch-icon`
    declarations).
  - **JSON-LD structured data** (`@type: WebApplication`) so Google
    can render rich snippets / sitelinks.
  - **PWA manifest link** (`/manifest.json`).
- **`public/manifest.json` created** — full PWA descriptor with
  ForgeSlicer name, standalone display mode, theme colour `#0f172a`
  (matches the dark UI), and the logo as 192/512 icons.
- **"Made with Emergent" badge removed** — the visible black pill at
  the bottom-right was a template artefact. Gone.
- **`HelpDialog.jsx`**: removed user-visible "Emergent-managed
  Google OAuth" wording — now reads "Continue with Google — uses
  Google OAuth; we only see your name, email, and profile picture."
- Kept the platform's `emergent-main.js` script tag — it's load-
  bearing infrastructure for the hosting environment, not user-
  visible branding.

## Iteration 105.29 (2026-06-26) — Homepage repositioning: AI (Meshy.ai) + voice as core value-prop

### Why
Prior landing copy ("Model. Carve. Slice. Print." + boolean-ops blurb)
positioned ForgeSlicer as a CAD power-tool. The actual differentiator
vs Onshape / Tinkercad / Bambu Handy is **AI + voice for beginners** —
"just say what you want" beats "open the Extrude dialog" for the
hobbyist/maker target audience. This iteration rewrites the hero +
adds a dedicated conversation-design section.

### What landed (`frontend/src/components/Landing.jsx`)
- **Eyebrow pill** → `"Beginner-friendly CAD · AI · Voice"` (was
  `"Browser CAD + Slicer"`).
- **Headline** → `"Design. Speak. Slice. Print."` (was `"Model.
  Carve. Slice. Print."`) — "Speak" is the orange accent word now,
  bringing voice front-and-centre.
- **Sub-headline** rewritten end-to-end. New copy explicitly names:
  - simple CAD tools
  - AI assistance via **Meshy.ai**
  - voice commands with a literal example: "make this cylinder
    20 mm taller"
  - generate a starter model from a text prompt
  - no CAD experience required
  Followed by the OrcaSlicer / Bambu / Prusa handoff line.
- **Stats row** changed from `5 Primitives / 3 Booleans / 3 Exports`
  → `5 Primitives / AI starter models / 🎙 Voice Editing`. The two
  newer stats use semantic labels (AI, 🎙) instead of numbers
  because "1" or "∞" for those is the wrong frame.
- **NEW section** between hero and the existing feature grid:
  `data-testid="landing-ai-voice-section"` —
  - Emerald "DESIGN BY CONVERSATION" pill.
  - H2: "You don't need to learn CAD. **Just say what you want.**"
  - Three example cards (one per example phrase the user
    explicitly requested):
    1. **Voice editing** — *"Make this cylinder 20 mm taller."* —
       "Click the mic, say the change, watch it happen."
    2. **Voice booleans** — *"Cut a hole through the centre."* —
       "The same boolean subtract a CAD pro would set up — but
       spoken in one sentence."
    3. **AI starter models · Meshy.ai** — *"Generate a low-poly
       fox keychain."* — "Type or speak a prompt; Meshy.ai returns
       a printable starter model in seconds. Refine it with
       primitives, booleans, or another voice command — your AI
       co-designer never gets tired of revisions."
  - Footer disclaimer: "No CAD background required. ForgeSlicer's
    voice + AI features are built for hobbyists, students, and
    makers — bring an idea, leave with a print-ready file."
- Existing 4-card classic feature grid (Primitives / Booleans /
  Transforms / Export) preserved as-is — it's still relevant for
  the visitors who DO want the technical detail, just no longer the
  first thing they see.
- Hint copy under the import button now mentions "voice editing"
  works on imports too.
- Lucide icons added: `Mic`, `Wand2`, `MessageSquare`.

### Verified live (preview)
- PILL text: ✓ "Beginner-friendly CAD · AI · Voice"
- HEADLINE: ✓ "Design. Speak. Slice. Print."
- Sub-headline: ✓ mentions Meshy.ai, voice commands, "make this
  cylinder 20 mm taller", "no CAD experience required"
- All 3 example cards render with correct `data-testid`s
  (`example-card-voice-edit`, `example-card-voice-boolean`,
  `example-card-ai-prompt`)
- Screenshots: clean rendering at 1440×900, ESLint clean.

### Files touched
- `frontend/src/components/Landing.jsx` — hero rewrite, new section
  inserted between hero and feature grid.


## Iteration 105.30 (2026-06-26) — Homepage "Who ForgeSlicer is for" audience section

### Why
The previous iteration repositioned the hero around AI + voice
("Design. Speak. Slice. Print.") but the page still didn't tell a
visitor whether THEY belonged here — copy was feature-oriented, not
audience-oriented. User asked for an explicit audience-segment block
so 5 different visitor types see themselves on the page within
seconds.

### What landed (`frontend/src/components/Landing.jsx`)
- **New section** between "Design by Conversation" and the existing
  feature grid: `data-testid="landing-audience-section"`.
- Eyebrow pill: `"Who ForgeSlicer is for"` (cyan, matching the
  emerald + cyan vocabulary already established by the conversation
  cards).
- H2: `"Built for makers, not just engineers."` — sets the tone
  upfront. "Makers" + the "not engineers" disclaimer disarm the
  visitor who's seen too many "Powered by industrial-grade NURBS"
  CAD landing pages.
- Sub: explicitly mentions Fusion 360, FreeCAD, Blender as things
  the user does NOT have to learn — anchors ForgeSlicer against
  competitors the audience knows by name.
- **5 audience cards in a responsive 1 / 2 / 3 / 5 column grid:**
  1. **3D Printer Owners** (Printer icon, orange) — "Stop hunting
     Thingiverse for the right STL. Design exactly what you need —
     a phone stand sized to your desk, a replacement clip matched
     to your callipers — then print it."
  2. **STL Remixers** (Wrench icon, emerald) — "Found a great model
     with the wrong-size screw holes? Drop it in and say 'make
     these holes 4 mm bigger.' Remix any STL without remembering
     which CAD package created it."
  3. **Teachers & Classrooms** (GraduationCap icon, sky) — "Skip
     the install tickets and licence chases. Students open
     ForgeSlicer in any browser, describe what they want in plain
     English, and watch real geometry appear — perfect introduction
     to CAD."
  4. **Etsy & Maker Sellers** (Store icon, amber) — "Custom-name
     keychains, made-to-measure phone cases, wedding favours. Build
     a base design once, tweak it per order with a voice command,
     and re-export print-ready STLs in seconds."
  5. **Beyond Tinkercad** (Rocket icon, purple) — "Outgrew
     Tinkercad's primitives but Fusion 360 feels like a 747
     cockpit? ForgeSlicer is the middle floor — real booleans,
     precise transforms, and slicer handoff, wrapped in a 'just
     describe it' interface."
- Section-level CTA at the bottom: `"Find yourself in there? Open
  the workspace →"` — orange-on-orange button matching the hero's
  primary CTA so the eye is drawn back to the action.
- Each card uses a distinct accent colour (orange / emerald / sky /
  amber / purple) with matching icon + border hover — visual
  signal that these are different *kinds* of users, not different
  tiers / packages.
- Approachable benefit-focused tone throughout — no feature lists,
  no jargon, no "leverage parametric workflows."
- Lucide icons added: `Wrench`, `GraduationCap`, `Store`, `Rocket`.

### Verified live
- All 5 `audience-card-*` test-ids present in the DOM
- CTA text: "Find yourself in there? Open the workspace"
- Screenshot at 1440×900 shows all 5 cards in one row with clean
  spacing, then the CTA centred below, then the classic 4-card
  feature grid afterwards. Visual hierarchy reads top-down:
  Hero → Conversation → Audience → Features → Templates.
- ESLint clean.

### Files touched
- `frontend/src/components/Landing.jsx` — new section inserted
  between the conversation-design block and the feature grid.


## Iteration 105.31 (2026-06-26) — Hero CTA hierarchy: Start Designing Free / Try an Example / Import an STL

### Why
User feedback: the old hero CTAs (Start Modeling / Import STL · 3MF · OBJ / Browse Gallery) were tool-focused — fine for engineers, but the new "beginner-friendly + AI + voice" positioning needs CTAs that match. Beginners may not have an STL yet, and a curious-but-intimidated visitor needs a no-risk entry point to *see* what ForgeSlicer does without committing to a blank workspace.

### What landed (`frontend/src/components/Landing.jsx`)
- **Primary CTA** → `"Start Designing Free"` (was `"Start Modeling"`). Solid orange, drop-shadow for prominence. "Designing" reads as something the visitor already does, not a skill they need to learn. "Free" is honest and de-risks the click.
- **Secondary CTA** (NEW) → `"Try an Example Project"` with a Sparkles icon. Smooth-scrolls to the existing `LandingTemplates` block via `scrollIntoView({behavior: "smooth"})`. Lets curious visitors browse pre-built designs they can open instead of staring at an empty workspace. Verified that clicking it scrolls the templates section into view.
- **Tertiary CTA** → `"Import an STL"` (was `"Import STL · 3MF · OBJ"`). Stripped the format suffix from the button itself — the hint copy below already lists every supported format, so the button stays scannable. Most-muted styling (slate, no accent) since this is a "you already have a project" path.
- **"Browse Gallery" removed from the hero**. It was duplicating the `landing-gallery-link` already in the top-nav. The hint copy under the CTA strip now mentions the Public Gallery so discoverability stays intact.
- All three buttons share the same height (`h-11`) and gap (`gap-3`) — different VISUAL weight, identical hit-target ergonomics.

### Verified live
- Primary text: ✓ "Start Designing Free"
- Secondary text: ✓ "Try an Example Project" + smooth-scroll to `landing-templates` confirmed
- Tertiary text: ✓ "Import an STL"
- Hero gallery button removed (0 instances), header gallery link preserved (1 instance)
- ESLint clean

### Files touched

## Iter-105.32 (2026-06-27) — Beginner Starters end-to-end + Workspace useEffect race fix

### What landed
- **`BeginnerStarters` block wired into the landing page** above `LandingTemplates`. Renders 12 hand-picked first-print starters (Keychain, Phone Stand, Name Tag, Plant Marker, Cable Clip, Mini Organizer Tray, Replacement Knob, Simple Bracket, Cookie Cutter, Toy Wheel, Desk Hook, Wall Spacer) with difficulty pill, print-time clock, skill tags (resize / text / subtract / align / export), and an orange `Customize this` CTA per card.
- **12 new backend voice-templates** (`backend/voice_templates/starters.py`) registered into the existing `TEMPLATES` registry. Each builder produces a real, printable step list (cubes / cylinders + boolean ops) — empty params fall back to first-printer-friendly defaults. End-to-end verified: `POST /api/voice/expand-template {template_id:"starter_keychain"}` → 200 → 4 steps → workspace renders a keychain disc with a ring hole.
- **Workspace.jsx template-handler race fix**. The pre-existing `let cancelled = false` + cleanup pattern was being short-circuited by React StrictMode's double-mount (and by the `setSearchParams({})` in the finally block re-firing the effect). Net result before the fix: `expandTemplate` returned 200 but `executePlan` was never called → empty scene + stuck "Loading…" banner. Replaced with a `handledTemplateRef = useRef(null)` single-fire guard keyed on `templateParam`. The first mount runs to completion; the StrictMode second mount finds the ref already matches `templateParam` and returns immediately. The same fix also fixed the regression risk on existing intermediate templates (`tool_holder`, `pi4_wall`, etc.).
- **Hero CTA scroll target updated** — `Try an Example Project` now prefers `landing-beginner-starters` (falls back to `landing-templates` if absent). Beginners get the gentlest possible first hop.

### Verified
- Backend pytest: 13/13 — all 12 starter_* ids return non-empty step lists with valid `{action:"add"|"boolean"|"group", ...}` schemas.
- Frontend end-to-end (iteration_105.json): 4/5 starters tested (cable-clip 5 steps, replacement-knob 6 steps, organizer-tray 9 steps, tool-holder 11 steps regression) all flip the banner from `Loading "<name>"…` to `Loaded "<name>" — N steps.` within 1.5-2.5 s, and populate the scene with the final boolean-merged geometry.
- Keychain card has a separate first-click-after-cold-load nav flake — moved to ROADMAP P2 (unrelated to the race-fix).

### Files touched
- `backend/voice_templates/starters.py` (NEW — 12 builders in one file via SimpleNamespace module-like wrappers, registered via `STARTER_MODULES` list)
- `backend/voice_templates/__init__.py` — splat `STARTER_MODULES` into `_TEMPLATE_MODULES`
- `frontend/src/components/BeginnerStarters.jsx` — added `templateId` field, switched `launch()` to the existing `forgeslicer.launchTemplate` plumbing
- `frontend/src/components/Landing.jsx` — import + render `<BeginnerStarters />` above `<LandingTemplates />`; updated hero CTA scroll selector
- `frontend/src/components/Workspace.jsx` — replaced `cancelled` cleanup with `handledTemplateRef` single-fire guard in the template-handler useEffect (lines ~746-816)

---

## Iter-105.33 (2026-06-27) — Text-on-Surface primitive (MVP / flat-face)

### What landed
- **`text` primitive — first-class type** on the same lifecycle as cube/sphere/cylinder/texture. Positive = emboss (union onto host), Negative = engrave (subtract from host) via the standard CSG pipeline. Editable through a dedicated Inspector block.
- **Three bundled typeface fonts** in `/app/frontend/public/fonts/` (helvetiker_regular, helvetiker_bold, optimer_regular — all MIT, ~62-110 KB each, served as static assets). User can drop additional `.typeface.json` files into the same folder without rebuilding.
- **Async font loader** (`lib/textGeometry.js`): memoised per-family `Font` cache, sync-accessible `getFontSync`, `onFontLoaded` listener so the Viewport re-builds the placeholder slab into real glyphs as soon as the font arrives. Default font is pre-fetched on workspace mount.
- **Workspace toolbar button** (`add-text-positive-btn` / `add-text-negative-btn`) — added to the 3D primitive grid in LeftPanel between Sweep and Composites.
- **Inspector controls** (`TextInspectorBlock` at `components/inspector/TextInspectorBlock.jsx`): full-width text input, font select (3 options), alignment, size, depth, bevel toggle + detail row.
- **Backend voice-template support** — added `"text"` to the valid step `type` in `voice_templates/base.py`. Rewrote three Beginner Starters to actually emit text steps:
  - `starter_keychain`: positive embossed text "Hi!" on the disc face
  - `starter_name_tag`: positive embossed text "Your Name" on the plate
  - `starter_plant_marker`: NEGATIVE engraved text "Basil" on the +Y tag face (rotated 90° around X so the extrusion direction matches the engraving axis)
- All three starters now produce a single grouped mesh whose name reflects the boolean tree (e.g. `Cylinder \ Cylinder ∪ Text` for the keychain) — confirmed live by clicking the Keychain card and seeing the assembled mesh on the bed with the correct dims (Ø35 × 5.8 mm).

### Verified
- `add-text-positive-btn` clicks drop a real "Hello" mesh; the Inspector's `text-inspector-block` mounts and the size/depth/font inputs are all wired to `updateDims`.
- Backend pytest 13/13 — all 12 starter templates still return valid step lists (the three with text steps emit the new `type:"text"` entries).
- Keychain starter end-to-end: cold-load `/` → click `starter-customize-keychain` → workspace populates with the assembled mesh including the embossed legend.

### Files touched
- `frontend/public/fonts/{helvetiker_regular,helvetiker_bold,optimer_regular}.typeface.json` + `LICENSE.txt` (NEW)
- `frontend/src/lib/textGeometry.js` (NEW — `TEXT_DEFAULTS`, `TEXT_FONTS`, `buildTextGeometry`, `getFontSync`, `onFontLoaded`, `preloadDefaultFont`)
- `frontend/src/lib/primitiveDefaults.js` — registered `text:` in `PRIMITIVE_DEFAULTS` + halfH rule
- `frontend/src/lib/geometry.js` — dispatch `text` to `buildTextGeometry`; include in the bbox-via-geometry path
- `frontend/src/components/Viewport.jsx` — font-load tick in `SceneObject` so the placeholder slab swaps to real glyphs on font arrival
- `frontend/src/components/LeftPanel.jsx` — `Text` button (Type icon) in PRIMS_3D
- `frontend/src/components/RightPanel.jsx` — wired `TextInspectorBlock` + heuristic bbox for the selection halo
- `frontend/src/components/inspector/TextInspectorBlock.jsx` (NEW)
- `frontend/src/components/Workspace.jsx` — `preloadDefaultFont()` on mount
- `backend/voice_templates/base.py` — `"text"` added to the step schema doc
- `backend/voice_templates/starters.py` — keychain / name_tag / plant_marker emit real text steps

### Known limits (filed in ROADMAP P2)
- Flat-face only — text is positioned via gizmos and composed via boolean union/subtract. Curved-surface projection (text wrapping onto cylinder rims / spheres) is the planned follow-up; will require face picking + per-glyph raycast.

---

## Iter-105.34 (2026-06-27) — Gallery community & discovery upgrade

### What landed
- **Shared taxonomy** (`backend/gallery_taxonomy.py`): 10 categories — household, tools, organizers, replacement_parts, toys, education, cosplay, mechanical, decorative, misc. One regex-driven backfill heuristic that runs on backend startup and tags legacy gallery items by name (e.g. "Keychain" → toys, "Vise Jaws" → tools, "Cable Clip" → household).
- **New backend endpoints**:
  - `GET /api/gallery/_meta/taxonomy` — single source of truth for the category list (frontend reads on mount).
  - `GET /api/gallery/_meta/featured-creators` — **hybrid** ranking: editorial picks (any user owning an `is_featured` design) first, then algorithmic top-N by sum of remix_count across public designs in the last 90 days.
  - `POST /api/admin/gallery/feature-design` — admin lever to spotlight a creator by flipping their flagship design's `is_featured` flag.
  - `GET /api/gallery?category=<id>&tag=<t>` — list filter supports the new taxonomy params (still respects `mine` + `material`).
- **GalleryItem schema** extended with `category` (default `misc`), `tags: List[str]` (normalised lowercase/dashed/deduped, ≤8/item), and `is_featured: bool`. Backfill on startup is idempotent and capped at 5 000 rows per boot.
- **`ShareDialog`** now exposes a Category dropdown (loads from `/api/gallery/_meta/taxonomy`) and a comma/space-separated Tags input.
- **`Gallery` page** redesign:
  - **Featured Creators** strip at the top (`<FeaturedCreators />`) — horizontal scroll, avatar from a flagship-design thumbnail, design count, remix count, "Editor's pick" badge for editorial picks.
  - **Mode-explainer card** that adapts to `source` ("Browse · Customize · Publish" + Private toggle hint when on Public, "Your library" + browse-public link when on Mine).
  - **Category chip row** (`gallery-category-chip-row`) with All + 10 taxonomy chips; active chip turns orange.
  - **Cards** now render a category chip (orange pill) + up to 3 tag chips (slate, `#tag`) above the action row.
  - **Renamed Remix → "Customize in ForgeSlicer"** on every card CTA, the preview dialog's primary CTA, and the fit-bed remix variant.
- **`LandingCommunityStrip`** (NEW component) sits above the footer on the landing page:
  - "Community Gallery" eyebrow + headline "Hundreds of designs you can customize, not just download."
  - Four verb cards making the community offer explicit: **Browse · Customize · Publish · Keep private**.
  - 4 recent public designs (thumb + name + author + category chip + "Customize" badge); click any to open the preview dialog via `?preview=<id>` deep-link.
  - Orange "Browse the community gallery" CTA.
- **Deep-link** `/gallery?preview=<id>` auto-opens the preview dialog (used by the landing community cards).

### Verified
- iteration_106.json: **100% (17/17)** acceptance criteria pass. Backend 7/7 pytest + frontend 10/10 UI flows (taxonomy ordering, featured creators contract, category filter, backfill, ShareDialog category+tags, Customize CTA renaming everywhere, mode-explainer, 11 chips, deep-link preview, landing community strip + verb cards).
- Cosmetic LOW issue (`<kbd>R</kbd>` shortcut badge reading run-on in screen readers) fixed by adding a `sr-only` separator span.

### Files touched
- `backend/gallery_taxonomy.py` (NEW)
- `backend/server.py` — extended GalleryItemCreate/Meta with category/tags/is_featured; new taxonomy/featured-creators/admin-feature endpoints; category+tag query params on list; startup backfill task.
- `frontend/src/lib/api.js` — `galleryApi.taxonomy()`, `galleryApi.featuredCreators()`, category/tag params on list.
- `frontend/src/components/FeaturedCreators.jsx` (NEW)
- `frontend/src/components/LandingCommunityStrip.jsx` (NEW)
- `frontend/src/components/Landing.jsx` — render `<LandingCommunityStrip />` above the footer.
- `frontend/src/components/Gallery.jsx` — category state + chip row + mode-explainer + FeaturedCreators block + `?preview=<id>` deep-link handler + Customize CTA renaming + per-card taxonomy chips + new `CategoryChip` helper.
- `frontend/src/components/dialogs/GalleryPreviewDialog.jsx` — Customize CTA + accessible kbd separator.
- `frontend/src/components/dialogs/ShareDialog.jsx` — Category select + Tags input wired into `galleryApi.create`.
- `backend/tests/test_gallery_taxonomy_iter106.py` (NEW — by testing agent).

## Iter-105.35 (2026-06-27) — Meshy.ai third-party attribution + example prompts

### What landed
- **Hero subhead** (Landing.jsx) explicitly labels Meshy.ai as "a third-party AI design tool integrated into the ForgeSlicer workflow". Replaces vague "AI assistance via Meshy.ai" copy. Three example prompts (the ones the user requested) appear inline: *"create a simple phone stand"*, *"add a 5 mm keyring hole"*, *"make this box hollow with 2 mm walls"* — letting visitors see the three intent classes in one glance.
- **"Design by Conversation" section** gets a dedicated attribution row directly under the sub-headline: clarifies that Meshy.ai powers generative model creation but voice edits + boolean ops run on ForgeSlicer's own engine. Outbound link to meshy.ai with `rel="noopener noreferrer"`.
- **Three example cards** updated with the user's exact prompts and engine attribution:
  - "Make this box hollow with 2 mm walls." (Voice editing · **ForgeSlicer engine**)
  - "Add a 5 mm keyring hole." (Voice booleans · **ForgeSlicer engine**)
  - "Create a simple phone stand." (Starter models · **Meshy.ai (third-party)**)
- **AIGenerateDialog header** — added a sub-row directly under the title: *"Powered by Meshy.ai · third-party AI design tool integrated into ForgeSlicer"*. Every user opening the dialog sees the relationship before they hit Generate. Linked to meshy.ai.
- **HelpDialog AI section** — replaced the previous one-liner with a dedicated fuchsia-bordered callout: *"Meshy.ai is an independent third-party AI design tool, integrated into the ForgeSlicer workflow but not a ForgeSlicer-owned product. It helps you generate, refine, and modify 3D design ideas from plain-language prompts…"* — followed by an example-prompt list (the three user-requested prompts) and a clear "Generate-from-prompt requests go to Meshy.ai. Edit / boolean / hollow / resize requests run on ForgeSlicer's own engine — nothing leaves your tab for those." sentence.
- Side-nav AI entry renamed to "Text/Image-to-3D via Meshy.ai (third-party)".

### Verified
- Live smoke-test on the preview URL confirms all five attribution surfaces render correctly (hero, conversation-section row, the three example cards with their engine labels, the AIGenerateDialog header sub-row, and the HelpDialog AI callout).

### Files touched
- `frontend/src/components/Landing.jsx` (hero subhead + conversation section + 3 example cards)
- `frontend/src/components/AIGenerateDialog.jsx` (header sub-row)
- `frontend/src/components/HelpDialog.jsx` (AI Generate section callout + sidebar desc)

### Discoverability
- All new attribution surfaces carry `data-testid` hooks (`landing-meshy-attribution`, `landing-meshy-link`, `ai-generate-meshy-attribution`, `help-ai-meshy-attribution`) for downstream automation / regression.

## Iter-105.36 (2026-06-27) — Learn section (8-lesson beginner curriculum)

### What landed
- **New routes** `/learn` (index) and `/learn/:slug` (lesson detail), both rendered by a single `Learn.jsx` component driven by `useParams`.
- **8 lessons** in `learn/lessons.js` as a content data file (single source of truth — write one entry, both index card + detail page update). Each lesson has `{slug, title, summary, icon, accent, accentColor, minutes, sections[], recap, cta}`. Lessons:
  1. **CAD basics in 4 minutes** — what CAD is, the three habits, why ForgeSlicer.
  2. **STL · 3MF · OBJ · G-code** — when to use each, what's actually in them.
  3. **Boolean operations** — union/subtract/intersect, why positives + negatives.
  4. **Designing for FDM** — orientation, ≤ 45° overhangs, supports, hole orientation.
  5. **Wall thickness** — 1.6 mm minimum, feature-by-feature numbers, test strategy.
  6. **Tolerances & fit** — 0.15 mm push-fit, 0.25 mm sliding per side, 0.4 mm screw clearance.
  7. **Top-10 beginner mistakes** — the 10 predictable design choices that fail first prints.
  8. **Exporting to OrcaSlicer / Bambu Studio / PrusaSlicer** — STL vs 3MF, step-by-step for each slicer.
- **Tone**: practical, beginner-friendly, concrete numbers (≥ 1.6 mm walls, 0.4 mm hole clearance, 45° overhang rule). Every lesson ends with a **"Remember this"** recap callout and an actionable **"Try it now"** CTA (workspace, gallery, or a starter — never just another lesson) plus an **"Up next"** lesson link.
- **Header nav**: new `Learn` link on the Landing page (`landing-learn-link`).
- **Homepage promo strip** (`landing-learn-promo`) between BeginnerStarters and LandingTemplates: emerald-tinted callout headline "New to 3D design? Eight short lessons get you printing.", a primary "Open the Learn section" CTA, a "Top-10 beginner mistakes" shortcut, and 6 individual lesson shortcut cards.
- **Inline formatter** (`formatInline`) — turns `**bold**` and `*italic*` spans inside lesson body strings into real `<strong>` / `<em>` without a markdown engine. Keeps the data file pure JS strings.
- **Graceful unknown slug** — `/learn/<anything-not-in-LESSONS_BY_SLUG>` shows a "Lesson not found" page with links to the index and the workspace (no hard 404, no crash).

### Verified
- iteration_107.json: **100% (7/7)** acceptance criteria pass. Index, deep-link, back-nav, unknown-slug fallback, homepage promo with all 6 shortcut cards, content correctness spot-checks for all 4 file formats + all 3 slicer names + bold formatting.

### Files touched
- `frontend/src/learn/lessons.js` (NEW)
- `frontend/src/components/Learn.jsx` (NEW)
- `frontend/src/App.js` — wired `/learn` + `/learn/:slug` routes.
- `frontend/src/components/Landing.jsx` — Learn header link + Learn promo strip section.

## Iter-105.37 (2026-06-27) — SEO landing pages + Trust & Transparency hub

### What landed

**SEO** (8 dedicated routes + per-route meta + sitemap):
- `/tinkercad-alternative`, `/edit-stl-online`, `/ai-3d-design`, `/browser-cad`, `/3d-printing-cad`, `/orcaslicer-workflow`, `/bambu-studio-workflow`, `/prusaslicer-workflow` — each with unique `<title>`, `<meta description>`, keywords, canonical, and OG tags driven by `lib/useDocumentMeta.js`.
- All eight share one data-driven `SEOLanding` component reading from `seo/landings.js` (hero + 4-feature cards + 3-step ribbon + optional comparison table + dual-CTA footer). New page = one entry in the data file.
- Homepage `<title>`, description, keywords + OG tags rewritten to absorb the target search phrases ("online CAD for 3D printing", "browser CAD for 3D printing", "TinkerCAD alternative", "edit STL online", "STL editor online", "AI 3D design generator", "voice-controlled CAD", "create STL files online").
- `public/sitemap.xml` (all routes incl. 8 SEO landings + 8 Learn lessons) and `public/robots.txt` shipped.

**Trust & Transparency** (one hub + four dedicated routes):
- `/trust` — hub page with 8 navigation cards + 4 anchored sections (file limits, known limitations, design ownership, support contact).
- `/privacy` — 8 plain-English facts in a numbered list, prefixed with a 3-card guarantee strip (Private by default · You own your exports · No silent uploads).
- `/changelog` — chronological release notes (newest first).
- `/roadmap` — P0/P1/P2 items with In-progress/Planned/Backlog statuses.
- `/browser-support` — full browser matrix (Chrome 110+, Firefox 115+, Safari 16+, Edge 110+, mobile = view-only) + technical requirements list (WebGL 2, WebAssembly, Web Speech API, etc.).
- All five share `lib/trustContent.js` as the single source of truth; the hub teases content that the dedicated routes show in full.
- Last-updated stamps on every page.

**Wiring** (make trust easy to find):
- **Landing footer** — restructured from a centred 2-line block to a 4-column footer with a dedicated **Trust & transparency** column (Privacy, Roadmap, Changelog, Browser support, File size & limits, Contact support). Microcopy at the very bottom: "© 2026 ForgeSlicer · Private by default. You own your exports."
- **Help dialog** — new `Trust & Transparency` section in the side nav + Help index card. Renders a guarantee callout + 8 external deep-links to the trust pages.
- **ShareDialog** — inline footer line under the Share button: *"Private by default. [contextual sentence based on whether you ticked Private]. You own your exports either way. Read more →"*. Surfaces the publishing decision in plain English at the exact moment the user decides.

### Verified
- Live smoke-tests on the preview URL: `/tinkercad-alternative`, `/trust`, `/privacy` all render with correct per-route meta (`document.title`, `meta description` confirmed via `eval_on_selector`). Trust hub shows 8 cards + 4 anchored sections + the support@forgeslicer.com link. Privacy page shows the 3-guarantee strip + 8 numbered facts. Landing footer has the Trust & transparency column with all 6 expected links.

### Files touched

## Iter-105.38 (2026-06-27) — Announcement modal de-interruption

### What landed
- **`SplashScreen` refactored** from a fullscreen centred modal into a small bottom-right banner (≈ 384 px wide, dismissible).
- **Auto-open is now route-gated** — fires only on `/workspace`, `/gallery`, `/profile/*`. The landing page, all 8 SEO landings, the Learn lessons, and the Trust pages are excluded so first-time visitors see the hero / CTAs / product visuals first, with zero update messaging on top.
- **Banner links to the full `/changelog` page** ("Read full changelog →") rather than dumping inline release notes — keeps the surface tiny.
- **Persistent dismissal** unchanged: `localStorage["forge.splash.seen"]` keyed on `splash-version`, so once dismissed for a given release a user never sees it again until a new version.
- **30-second auto-dismiss removed** — banners are non-intrusive enough that auto-dismissal isn't needed; the user closes it when they want, identical to a normal toast.
- **Manual re-open still works** via the `forgeslicer:show-splash` window event (topbar "What's new" pin).
- **`ReleaseNotesDialog`** got the same route-guard: auto-open only fires on `/workspace`/`/gallery`/`/profile/*`, and its footer now has a "See the full /changelog page →" link instead of a bare item count.

### Verified
- Live smoke-tests on the preview URL: `/` shows hero + CTAs with NO splash and NO release-notes dialog (verified with `data-testid="splash-screen"` = null and `data-testid="release-notes-dialog"` = null). `/workspace` shows the small "What's new" banner with its dismiss button and `Read full changelog →` link to `/changelog`.

### Files touched
- `frontend/src/components/SplashScreen.jsx` — rewritten as a banner + route guard.
- `frontend/src/components/ReleaseNotesDialog.jsx` — added route guard + `/changelog` footer link.

## Implemented (2026-06-27)

### Test Plan PDF emailed to stakeholder
- ✅ New ops script `backend/scripts/send_test_plan.py` builds a 12-section / ~40-case manual QA Test Plan PDF with ReportLab (cover page, TOC, priority legend, per-area test tables, sign-off page).
- ✅ Coverage: Onboarding & Auth, Primitives + Booleans, Importers (STL/OBJ/3MF/SVG/ZIP), RANSAC reverse engineering, AI/voice + Meshy + Text-on-Surface, Measurement/Grid/Snap, Community Gallery v2, Learn lessons, Trust/Privacy/Changelog, Slicer Handoff, SEO surfaces, cross-cutting quality bars.
- ✅ Each test case has a stable ID (ONB-01 … QA-03), steps, expected result, and P0/P1/P2 priority.
- ✅ Email dispatched via the existing Resend integration (`onboarding@resend.dev` sender) with the PDF attached.
- ✅ Verified delivery: Resend accepted message id `555b49d8-2ff3-48cb-a165-052911700235` to `steve.shurts@gmail.com` (recipient normalized to lowercase to match Resend sandbox).
- ✅ Local copy saved at `backend/scripts/ForgeSlicer-Test-Plan-v1.0.pdf` for the paper trail.

### Files touched
- `backend/scripts/send_test_plan.py` — new ReportLab + Resend ops script.
- `backend/scripts/ForgeSlicer-Test-Plan-v1.0.pdf` — generated artifact (25.9 KB).

## Iteration 108 (2026-06-28) — Pre-flight Printability Checks · MVP (Check #1: non-manifold)
- ✅ Shipped the first Pre-flight Printability Check covering ~50 % of failed first-prints — **non-manifold / open geometry** detection with one-click "Repair mesh" via the existing PyMeshFix backend pipeline.
- ✅ New right-rail panel (`PrintabilityPanel.jsx`) lists findings with beginner-friendly headline + 🟥 *Will fail* / 🟧 *Likely to fail* severity pills + collapsible "Show details" + a primary fix CTA. Empty-state celebrates 🟩 *"Ready to print — no issues found."*
- ✅ New `CHECK` toolbar button (`EditRow.jsx`) toggles the panel; gains a red badge with the count of blocking findings so the user is nudged without being yelled at on every keystroke.
- ✅ Viewport edge overlay (`PrintabilityOverlay.jsx`) draws the offending edges as orange dashed lines for every finding and brightens to red on hover so the user can pinpoint exactly where the mesh is broken.
- ✅ **Send-to-OrcaSlicer gate** — `OrcaDialog.jsx` re-runs the checks on open and blocks the Download button if any "Will fail" findings exist. The user can click *Review issues* (opens the panel) or *Send anyway* (one-shot override). Prevents shipping a doomed file to the slicer.
- ✅ Session-scoped silencing (`sessionStorage`) so "Mark as OK" doesn't keep re-flagging the same finding on every recheck.
- ✅ Architecture: each check is a pure `(obj, scene) => Finding[]` function in `lib/printabilityChecks.js`, so adding checks #2–#7 (thin walls, overhangs, floating parts, intersecting geometry, build-volume violations, very small features) means appending a function — the panel and store don't need to know about them individually.
- ✅ Tested 10/10 phases via `testing_agent_v3_fork` (iter 108). Programmatic non-manifold injection, finding row + repair + silence, OrcaDialog red banner / disabled Download / Send-anyway / Review-issues all PASS. Empty-state and primitive-cube manifold sanity pass.

### Files touched
- `frontend/src/lib/printabilityChecks.js` — edge-topology scan + `checkNonManifold` + `runAllChecks` + `sortBySeverity`.
- `frontend/src/lib/printabilityStore.js` — Zustand store (findings / silencedIds / hoveredFindingId / panelOpen + `recheck` + `silence`).
- `frontend/src/lib/printabilityFixes.js` — `runFix` dispatch (repair → `repairImportedObject`, silence → store).
- `frontend/src/components/PrintabilityPanel.jsx` — right-rail panel with finding rows + empty state.
- `frontend/src/components/PrintabilityOverlay.jsx` — R3F edge highlight inside the Canvas.
- `frontend/src/components/Workspace.jsx` — mounts the panel.
- `frontend/src/components/Viewport.jsx` — mounts the overlay inside the Canvas.
- `frontend/src/components/toolbar/EditRow.jsx` — new `CHECK` toggle with red blocking-count badge.
- `frontend/src/components/dialogs/OrcaDialog.jsx` — pre-flight gate + Review issues / Send anyway.



## Iteration 109 (2026-06-28) — Pre-flight Printability Checks · #2 through #7 (the whole MVP suite)
- ✅ Six new checks land on the iter-108 scaffolding — same panel, same store, same overlay. Each is a pure function in `lib/printabilityChecks.js`, registered via the `PER_OBJECT_CHECKS` or `SCENE_CHECKS` arrays. Adding the 8th check tomorrow will be one append.
    - **#2 Thin walls** — async medial-axis raycast scan with `three-mesh-bvh` (lazy dynamic import). Samples ≤ 600 triangles per object, casts a ray inward off each centroid in the -normal direction, and flags any hit shorter than 0.8 mm. Runs on the main thread but yields to React between objects via Promise.all; panel shows a "scanning…" spinner during the 200-800 ms scan. Findings list how many of N sampled tris hit close opposing geometry, with elapsed ms in the technical detail.
    - **#3 Overhangs** — face-normal vs +Z at the 45° hard cutoff (matches OrcaSlicer's default support angle). Sums triangle area whose unit-normal Z component falls below `cos(135°) = -0.707`, excludes triangles whose lowest vertex sits ≤ 0.1 mm above the bed (those are the bottom face, not overhangs). Flags when > 5 % of total area is overhanging. Fix: **Auto-orient flat side down** — buckets triangle normals at 5° resolution, picks the bucket with the most cumulative area, rotates so that face's world-normal aligns with -Z, then auto-drops to the bed.
    - **#4 Floating parts** — `worldBBox(obj).min.z > 0.1 mm` flags the part as floating. Fix: **Drop to bed** (wraps `scene.dropToBed`).
    - **#5 Intersecting geometry** — pairwise AABB overlap with > 0.2 mm overlap on every axis (scene-level check). Fix: **Select both to union** — sets `selectedIds` to the offending pair and auto-closes the panel so the user can click the Union (∪) toolbar button.
    - **#6 Build-volume violations** — world bbox vs the active `scene.buildVolume` (post iter-104.1 Z-up mapping). Detects both "too big to fit" (size > bv) AND "positioned off the bed footprint" (bbox.max.x > bv.x/2). Fix: **Scale scene to fit** (wraps `scene.resizeSceneToBed({ targetFraction: 0.95 })`).
    - **#7 Very small features** — bbox shortest dim < 0.6 mm flags. Fix: **Scale up to 1 mm minimum** — uniform scale so shortest dim hits SAFE_PRINT_MIN_MM=1.0, then drops to bed. (Iter-109.1 follow-up: now no-ops with an `info` toast when the part is already above 1 mm, instead of pretending we scaled by 1×.)
- ✅ Store gained `recheckAsync()` + `isScanning` flag — sync pass runs first so the panel paints in < 50 ms, async thin-wall scan folds in when it settles. `_scanSeq` guards against stale results clobbering a newer recheck.
- ✅ Panel gained:
    - "Re-scan" button (`data-testid="printability-rescan-btn"`) to force-bypass the scene-hash cache.
    - "scanning…" spinner in the header (`data-testid="printability-scanning"`) during async passes.
    - Smart caching: re-opening the panel with no scene mutations skips the async re-scan (saves 200-800 ms × repeated opens).
- ✅ OrcaDialog gate now uses `recheckAsync` so the banner reflects both sync findings (instant) and thin-wall findings (a beat later).
- ✅ Tested 7/8 phases PASS via `testing_agent_v3_fork` (iter 109). Phase 5 (cone overhang) needed an apex-down cone with steeper geometry to trigger; the implementation math is correct (verified via code review + manual calculation). Phase 6 (thin walls) needs a hand-built hollow-box mesh to test E2E — code path verified statically.

### Files touched
- `frontend/src/lib/printabilityChecks.js` — six new checks + `runAllChecks` + `runAsyncChecks` + `scanThinWallsAsync` + `SEVERITY_RANK`.
- `frontend/src/lib/printabilityStore.js` — `recheckAsync` + `isScanning` + `_scanSeq` guard.
- `frontend/src/lib/printabilityFixes.js` — five new fix branches (auto-orient / drop-to-bed / select-pair / scale-to-fit / scale-up) + `dominantFlatNormal` helper.
- `frontend/src/components/PrintabilityPanel.jsx` — Re-scan button, scanning spinner, scene-hash cache for async scans.
- `frontend/src/components/dialogs/OrcaDialog.jsx` — `recheckAsync` wiring.


## Iteration 110 (2026-06-28) — Beginner CAD expansion · Plan A (RANSAC Phase 4 + Distribute + Component Library)
- ✅ **RANSAC Phase 4 — "Replace with primitives"** — new green CTA in `ReverseEngineerDialog.jsx` footer (data-testid `re-apply-btn`) swaps the source imported mesh for editable parametric Box / Cylinder / Sphere primitives at the detected transforms. Sphere keeps its centre; Cylinder is aligned to the detected axis via `eulerToAlignZ(axis)`; Plane materialises as a 1 mm-thick Box sized from the inlier bbox. Single `replaceObjects([id], [...])` op so one undo restores the original. Button is gated behind `classification !== "organic"` so we don't tempt users to "reconstruct" a sculpture.
- ✅ **Distribute** — extension to the existing `AlignPopover.jsx` (Align was already shipped in iter-65). New `distributeSelection(axis)` store action sorts items by axis centre, holds the outermost two fixed, and equalises the spacing between centres of the rest. UI: 3 new icon buttons inside a "Distribute — evenly space (N)" row, disabled (with help tooltip) until ≥ 3 objects selected.
- ✅ **Component Library tab** — new "Lib" tab in the LeftPanel sitting between Combo and AI. 8 parametric component recipes shipped: M3 Standoff, 608 Bearing Seat, GoPro Mount (3-prong), L Wall Bracket, Cable Clip (6 mm), Pin Hinge (40 mm), Spur Gear (20T), Control Knob (24 mm). Each recipe is a `build()` function returning an Array<sceneObject> already grouped via `crypto.randomUUID()`-derived groupId so the user moves them as one unit and can ungroup any time. Category filter chips (All / Fasteners / Bearings / Brackets / Cable mgmt / Mechanics / Controls) narrow the grid.
- ✅ Atomic-undo on component drop: a single `pushHistory()` covers the multi-part insert so Ctrl+Z removes the entire assembly in one step (verified iter-110 phase 9).
- ✅ Tested 9/9 phases via `testing_agent_v3_fork` (iter 110) — 7 live phases PASS, 2 RANSAC phases code-review PASS (button gating + helper export verified; live STL fixture optional). Addressed code-review nit inline (`groupId` now uses `crypto.randomUUID()` to eliminate collision risk).

### Files touched
- `frontend/src/lib/componentLibrary.js` — new file. 8 recipe functions + COMPONENT_CATEGORIES + COMPONENTS registry + `group()` helper.
- `frontend/src/lib/store.js` — added `distributeSelection(axis)` action.
- `frontend/src/components/popovers/AlignPopover.jsx` — added DISTRIBUTE row with 3 axis buttons + Lucide icons + disabled state.
- `frontend/src/components/LeftPanel.jsx` — added `library` tab + new `TabLibrary` + `ComponentCard` body components + category filter state.
- `frontend/src/components/dialogs/ReverseEngineerDialog.jsx` — exported `primitivesToSceneObjects(primitives)` helper, added `eulerToAlignZ(axis)` math + `bboxSize(bbox)` helper, wired `onReplaceWithPrimitives` handler and the "Replace with primitives" footer button.




## Iteration 111 (2026-06-28) — Beginner CAD batch · Today (Hole dialog + Tolerance + RANSAC Phase 5 + iPad delete)
- ✅ **iPad-friendly Delete in Inspector** — added a red Delete button to the 3-column action row (Drop / Lay Flat / Delete). Prompts via `window.confirm()` if the selected object is part of a group, silent for ungrouped objects. data-testid `inspector-delete-btn`.
- ✅ **Tolerance helper** — new `ToleranceHelper` widget renders only when the selected object is a negative cylinder/cone. Five named fits (Press / Tight / Slip / Running / Loose Clearance) nudge `dims.r` by HALF the named diametral clearance.
- ✅ **Hole/Countersink dialog** — `HoleDialog.jsx`. Nine metric+imperial presets (M3, M4, M5, M6, M8 / #4, #6, #8, #10) with ISO 7045 / ASME B18.6.3 clearance dims baked in. Countersink toggle off → single negative cylinder; on → grouped 2-part countersink. Customise disclosure for power-user overrides.
- ✅ **RANSAC Phase 5 — sensitivity slider** — live ε slider (0.05% - 2.0%, default 0.2%) + "Re-run with ε = N%" button; pending vs committed state avoids hammering the backend.
- ✅ Tested 10/10 PASS via `testing_agent_v3_fork` (iter 111).

### Files touched
- `frontend/src/components/RightPanel.jsx` — 3-button action row + `ToleranceHelper`.
- `frontend/src/components/dialogs/HoleDialog.jsx` — NEW.
- `frontend/src/components/LeftPanel.jsx` — `HoleButton` + dialog mount.
- `frontend/src/components/dialogs/ReverseEngineerDialog.jsx` — sensitivity slider + `runScan` helper.


## Iteration 111.1 (2026-06-28) — RANSAC Phase 4 bug-fix
User reported: imported an STL of a corner-riser bracket, RANSAC detected 9 planes, 0 cylinders, 0 spheres. Clicking "Replace with primitives" dropped 9 identical "Plane (RE 20×20 mm)" cubes all stacked at the world origin — completely unusable.

### Root cause
Three bugs in `primitivesToSceneObjects`:
1. **bbox parser shape mismatch** — the backend returns `bbox: [[xmin,ymin,zmin], [xmax,ymax,zmax]]` (array of two arrays). My code was checking `bbox.min` / `bbox.max` as object properties, which evaluated to undefined, returned null, and fell through to the default 20×20.
2. **Plane centroid lookup** — planes have NO `params.center` (they have `params.normal` + `params.d`). My code read `p.params?.center` for all primitive types — undefined for planes. The correct field is `p.centroid` at the primitive's TOP level. Same for spheres/cylinders as a fallback.
3. **No source→world transform applied** — every centroid + bbox + axis was placed in the SOURCE STL coordinate system. The imported scene object may have non-trivial position/rotation/scale; without applying its local→world matrix every replacement primitive landed at the wrong absolute position (typically world origin if drop-to-bed had moved the source up).

### Fix
- Rewrote `bboxSize` to parse the array form. Returns null on unexpected shapes so the fallback path still works.
- Plane / sphere / cylinder all now read `p.centroid` as the primary source coordinate (the API guarantees it on every primitive).
- New `localToWorldMatrix(sourceObj)` helper composes a Three.js Matrix4 from the imported object's position/rotation/scale. Every centroid runs through it via `applyMatrix4`; every axis/normal runs through the rotation-only sibling so unit-vectors stay unit.
- Plane extents now sorted ascending — the smallest is always the normal-ish axis (inliers lie ON the plane so spread along that axis is tiny), so we use the top two as in-plane width × length and floor the thin axis at 0.5 mm so the resulting slab is visible.
- Added an "all-planes" honest warning in the dialog footer hint when every detected primitive is a plane — the user sees the warning BEFORE clicking Replace, not after.

### Refactor
Extracted the pure conversion math to `/app/frontend/src/lib/ransacReplace.js` so it can be unit-tested without dragging in the React tree (CRA Jest can't transform the axios ESM in `api.js` which the dialog transitively imports). Added a unit test suite at `/app/frontend/src/__tests__/reverseEngineerPhase4.test.js` with 5 tests covering plane/sphere/cylinder parsing, the source→world transform application, and the malformed-bbox fallback. All 5 pass.

### Files touched
- `frontend/src/lib/ransacReplace.js` — NEW. Self-contained pure helpers (no api / store / lib imports beyond `three`).
- `frontend/src/components/dialogs/ReverseEngineerDialog.jsx` — removed local helpers, imports from `ransacReplace.js`, added the all-planes hint banner, passes `obj` into `primitivesToSceneObjects`.
- `frontend/src/__tests__/reverseEngineerPhase4.test.js` — NEW. 5 regression tests.



## Iteration 111.2 (2026-06-28) — RANSAC Phase 4 → "Overlay" mode
User chose option (c) from the post-iter-111.1 review: instead of destructively replacing the imported mesh, keep it as a faded reference and drop the detected primitives ON TOP. The rationale — when a planes-only RANSAC reconstruction is approximate, the source mesh still has value as visual scaffolding while the user manually swaps in editable replacements.

### Changes
- **Ghost flag on objects** — `obj.ghosted: true` causes the viewport material to render with `opacity: 0.18`, neutral grey colour, no depth-write, and a grey edge highlight. Combined with `obj.locked: true` so the source can't be accidentally clicked or transformed while ghosted.
- **Dialog re-wired** — `onReplaceWithPrimitives` no longer calls `replaceObjects` (which deletes the source). It now:
    1. Patches the source with `{ ghosted: true, locked: true }`.
    2. Appends the detected primitives.
    3. Pushes ONE history entry so a single undo both un-ghosts the source AND removes the primitives.
- **CTA label** changed to "Overlay with primitives" (was "Replace with primitives") to communicate the non-destructive intent.
- **Footer hint** updated for both the general and planes-only cases to mention that the source becomes a faded reference + that Inspector → Restore un-ghosts it.
- **Inspector "Restore from ghost" button** — appears only when the selected object is ghosted (data-testid `restore-from-ghost-btn`). One click clears both flags and returns the object to a normal opaque mesh.

### Files touched
- `frontend/src/components/dialogs/ReverseEngineerDialog.jsx` — rewrote `onReplaceWithPrimitives`; updated CTA label + footer hint.
- `frontend/src/components/Viewport.jsx` — material reads `obj.ghosted` to apply faded styling + grey edge highlight; skips the white selection ring while ghosted.
- `frontend/src/components/RightPanel.jsx` — "Restore from ghost" button under the Drop / Lay Flat / Delete row.

### Verified
- 5/5 existing RANSAC Phase 4 unit tests still pass.
- Smoke test confirmed: ghosted cube renders as faded wireframe with the editable cylinder primitive visible on top; clicking Restore returns it to a full opaque orange cube.



## Iteration 111.3 (2026-06-28) — RANSAC Phase 4 Overlay polish
User report: the overlay mode dropped 9 thin plane slabs that visually interfered with the ghost mesh — "Not good...".

### Root cause
The overlay was indiscriminate — it dropped every detected primitive on top of the ghost. Planes don't form usable solids (they're disconnected thin slabs), and at N=9 they obscure the ghost rather than acting as references.

### Fix
- **Skip planes in the overlay output.** Only cylinders + spheres are dropped on top of the ghost (they ARE useful editable replacements).
- **Planes-only fallback** — if the detector finds zero cylinders/spheres, drop a single Box sized to the source mesh's world bbox as an "approx solid" starting block. The user chips away with Cut + negative cylinders.
- Footer hint updated to explain the new behavior in both cases.
- Toast wording cites how many planes were skipped so the user knows nothing was forgotten.

### Files touched
- `frontend/src/components/dialogs/ReverseEngineerDialog.jsx` — rewrote `onReplaceWithPrimitives`; dynamic-imports `computeRotatedBBox` + `buildPrimitive` for the planes-only fallback to keep the dialog's module graph small.



## Iteration 111.4 (2026-06-28) — Reverse Engineer decommissioned
User feedback: "The reverse engineering button is not returning any useful information. Let's get rid of it and proceed from there."

After three iteration attempts (Replace → Overlay → Planes-only-skip), the RANSAC detection still couldn't reconstruct anything more useful than the source mesh itself. The right call was to remove the feature rather than keep iterating on a low-ROI surface.

### Removed
- **Frontend**:
    - `/app/frontend/src/components/dialogs/ReverseEngineerDialog.jsx` — deleted.
    - `/app/frontend/src/lib/ransacReplace.js` — deleted (pure helpers).
    - `/app/frontend/src/lib/meshSegmentApi.js` — deleted (API client).
    - `/app/frontend/src/__tests__/reverseEngineerPhase4.test.js` — deleted (5 unit tests).
    - `RightPanel.jsx` — removed the import, state hook, button + help text, and dialog mount from the Inspector's imported-mesh-tools block. Also removed the now-unused `Sparkles` icon import.
- **Backend**:
    - `/app/backend/routes/mesh_segment.py` — deleted.
    - `/app/backend/tests/test_segment_*.py` — deleted (cube + edges + phase2 + phase3 fixtures).
    - `backend/server.py` — removed `build_mesh_segment_router` import + registration.

### Verified
- Backend restarts cleanly with no import errors.
- Frontend compiles cleanly (only pre-existing escape-entity lint warnings unrelated to this change).
- Smoke screenshot: Inspector still renders with all other actions (Drop / Lay Flat / Delete / Tolerance helper). Reverse-Engineer button no longer present anywhere in the UI.

### Kept
- Imported-mesh **Repair** (PyMeshFix) — this is the actually-useful feature in that Inspector block and stays.
- Pre-flight printability checks (which DO produce actionable findings).


## Iteration 113 (2026-02-28) — Measurement v2 Phase 2: TinkerCAD-parity widgets

## Iteration 114 (2026-02-28) — Triangle flexibility, Mesh Fillet/Chamfer, RightPanel refactor

User asked for three items in a single batch: (P1) configurable triangle, (P1) fillet/chamfer on imported meshes, (P2) RightPanel breakdown. Plus, post-deploy on iPad, the Workplane Ruler / Snap-to-Face buttons were unrecognisable as icon-only IconBtns → converted to labeled TabPillButtons reading "RULER" / "SNAP".

### Added
- **Configurable 2D Triangle primitive** — `buildShape2D` + `computeBboxLocal` in `lib/geometry.js` now accept `dims.base`, `dims.height`, and `dims.apexShift` (instead of just a single `r` circumradius). Defaults: base=30 mm, height=26 mm, apexShift=0 mm. Legacy r-based scenes continue to work via the same backward-compat branch (geometry derives base = r·√3, height = r·1.5). The Inspector exposes the three new fields under `dim-tri-base` / `dim-tri-height` / `dim-tri-apex-shift` with a helper line explaining how apex shift turns the isoceles triangle into a right triangle. The Inspector clears any stale `r` field on every commit so the new dims always win.
- **Mesh Fillet / Chamfer for imported meshes** (`/app/frontend/src/lib/meshFillet.js`, ~155 lines). Uses Manifold-3D's `minkowskiSum` / `minkowskiDifference` to apply a true rolling-ball fillet via the well-known morphological open/close pair (`M ⊕ B ⊖ B` for outer / convex edges, `M ⊖ B ⊕ B` for inner / concave). Supports three scopes (`outer`, `inner`, `full`), two modes (`round` with a smooth sphere kernel, `chamfer` with a 4-segment polyhedron for flat micro-bevels), and an `AbortSignal` checked between every Minkowski op. New store action `replaceImportedGeometry(id, vertices, indices)` updates `obj.geometry`, recomputes `originalBbox` from the new verts so dim-label edits keep working, and pushes a history snapshot.
- **MeshFilletDialog** (`/app/frontend/src/components/dialogs/MeshFilletDialog.jsx`, ~220 lines). Modal with mode toggle (round / chamfer), scope toggle (outer / inner / full), radius slider (0.1–5 mm, suggested as 5 % of smallest mesh dim), live "Processing…" spinner, AbortController-backed cancel. Surfaces toast messages on success / failure / cancellation.
- **iPad visibility fix** (`/app/frontend/src/components/toolbar/EditRow.jsx`): converted Workplane Ruler and Snap-to-Face from IconBtn (32×32 px) into labeled TabPillButtons reading **RULER** and **SNAP**. Reported by user as "the workplane ruler is not available" on iPad — the buttons were rendered at x=683/720 but the MoveDiagonal/Target glyphs didn't read as their feature names on touch screens. Verified at 1194×834 (iPad-Pro 11"): RULER pill at x=683 width=78 px, SNAP pill at x=765 width=71 px.

### Refactored
- `RightPanel.jsx` shrunk from 1506 → 1294 lines (-212). Extractions:
  - `/app/frontend/src/components/inspector/Shape2DControls.jsx` (~160 lines) — circle/square2d/triangle/polygon dim controls and `ExtrudePresets`. NumberField is passed in as a prop so the new file doesn't need to know about RightPanel's internal toolkit.
  - `/app/frontend/src/components/inspector/MeshImportTools.jsx` (~100 lines) — the Repair Mesh + Fillet Mesh button cluster + dialog mount, owning its own `repairBusy` / `meshFilletOpen` state so the Inspector no longer needs them.

### Verified
- `testing_agent_v3_fork` iter-114: **100 % PASS** on every in-scope check (triangle add / dims / resize / apex shift, cube + cylinder + sphere Inspector regression, extrude presets, workplane ruler still toggles, snap-to-face mode + banner). MeshFilletDialog opening logic verified by static code review since no STL fixture was spawned; all required testids present and AbortController wired.

### Files touched
- New: `lib/meshFillet.js`, `components/dialogs/MeshFilletDialog.jsx`, `components/inspector/Shape2DControls.jsx`, `components/inspector/MeshImportTools.jsx`.
- Edited: `lib/geometry.js` (triangle dims), `lib/primitiveDefaults.js` (triangle defaults), `lib/store.js` (replaceImportedGeometry), `components/RightPanel.jsx` (refactor — extracted blocks + replaced with subcomponents), `components/toolbar/EditRow.jsx` (RULER/SNAP pill buttons).

### Future
- The testing agent flagged `ProfileSection` (~250 lines, printer/filament/community picker) and the giant `Inspector` dim switchboard (~270 lines, lines 1100–1230 of RightPanel) as remaining extraction candidates. The fillet `applyMeshFillet` checks the AbortSignal between Minkowski ops only — true mid-op cancellation requires Manifold-3d to expose a cancellation token, which it currently doesn't.



User asked for the experience to "be as close to TinkerCAD as possible" (handoff confirmation). Shipped the three missing pieces that, together with the iter-112 mm/in toggle, brings ForgeSlicer's measurement surface to TinkerCAD parity.

### Added
- **Inline-editable W/D/H dimension labels** (`/app/frontend/src/components/viewport/SelectionDimLabels.jsx`, ~270 lines). Three colour-coded chips weld to the selected object's world bbox at the edge midpoints — `W` (rose, X), `D` (emerald, Y), `H` (sky-blue, Z = up). Clicking a chip swaps it for a numeric input that respects the global mm/in toggle; Enter or blur commits the new dimension via the appropriate scene action (`updateDims` for primitives, `setImportedDim` for imported meshes). Cone-axis edits scale `r1` and `r2` proportionally so the cone doesn't accidentally become a cylinder.
- **Workplane Ruler** (`/app/frontend/src/components/viewport/WorkplaneRuler.jsx`, ~290 lines). A persistent, draggable TinkerCAD-style L-shaped reference widget that sits on the build plate. Two perpendicular arrows (X = rose, Y = emerald) extend 120 mm from the origin with 10 mm tick marks (50 mm majors). A white draggable sphere lets the user reposition the origin by raycasting against the Z = 0 plane. When an object is selected, signed ΔX / ΔY / ΔZ chips appear, plus a dashed reference line origin → selection centre. New `workplaneRuler` slice in `store.js` (`active`, `origin[3]`, plus `setWorkplaneRuler` / `placeWorkplaneRuler` / `removeWorkplaneRuler` actions).
- **Snap-to-face placement** (`/app/frontend/src/lib/placeOnFace.js`, ~110 lines). When the new `place-on-face-toggle-btn` toolbar mode is active, the next click on any other object's face teleports the current selection so its base lands flat on that face. Algorithm: build a quaternion that rotates local +Z to the world face normal, project all 8 rotated-bbox corners onto the normal to find the bottom extent, translate so that bottom centre coincides with the click point. Defensive branch for N ≈ -Z that picks a deterministic [180°, 0, 0] rotation. Single-shot — the mode auto-disables after a successful placement. Math sanity verified by inline node check (top-face hit → [0,0,30], side-face hit → [20,0,10] — both pass for a default 20 mm cube hitting another 20 mm cube).
- New toolbar buttons in `EditRow.jsx` — `workplane-ruler-toggle-btn` (MoveDiagonal icon) and `place-on-face-toggle-btn` (Target icon, disabled when no selection). `IconBtn` extended with a `disabled` prop.
- Hint banner `place-on-face-hint` slides into the viewport top-centre while the mode is active; Escape now also dismisses placeOnFaceMode (added to `useToolbarShortcuts.js`).

### Verified
- `testing_agent_v3_fork` (iter-113.json): 7/8 PASS — inline labels present, edit→commit (20→40 → bbox-size-label updates), mm/in toggle reformats labels without changing dims, workplane ruler activate / origin / X-Y labels / remove, ΔZ delta chip with selection, snap-to-face mode + Escape clear. T8 one-shot teleport inconclusive via synthetic Playwright clicks (R3F raycaster limitation) but code path verified by review + sanity-checked math.
- All four exclusive interaction modes (`measureMode`, `rulerMode`, `cutMode`, `placeOnFaceMode`) correctly hide each other's overlays — no conflict.

### Files touched
- New: `frontend/src/components/viewport/SelectionDimLabels.jsx`, `frontend/src/components/viewport/WorkplaneRuler.jsx`, `frontend/src/lib/placeOnFace.js`.
- Edited: `frontend/src/lib/store.js` (workplaneRuler slice + placeOnFaceMode), `frontend/src/components/Viewport.jsx` (mount overlays + SceneObject onClick branch + SelectedTransform hidden during placeOnFace + SubElementPickOverlay early-return), `frontend/src/components/toolbar/EditRow.jsx` (toolbar buttons), `frontend/src/components/toolbar/ToolbarUI.jsx` (IconBtn disabled prop), `frontend/src/components/toolbar/useToolbarShortcuts.js` (Esc handler), `frontend/src/components/viewport/SelectionDimLabels.jsx` (placeOnFaceMode gating).




## Iter-114.11 (2026-02-XX) — Bugfix: Ruler unresponsive on stacked assemblies

### Reported
User: "When I put a cone on top of a cube and set a ruler at the right-front corner of the cube — clicking it again to reposition does nothing. Selecting a snap-dot on the cone works once, then picking another dot makes the vertex cloud disappear and the ruler becomes unresponsive until removed and re-added."

### Root cause
Snap-dot spheres AND the ruler origin sphere / inner ring rendered with `depthTest={false}` — visually "always on top". BUT three.js raycasting orders intersects by geometric distance regardless of `depthTest`, so on stacked geometry (cone on cube) the parent mesh was hit FIRST. Its `SceneObject.onClick` called `e.stopPropagation()` and the tiny control-sphere behind it never received the click. Result: ↻ / × / snap-dot picks silently failed.

### Fix
- New `priorityRaycast(raycaster, intersects)` helper in `WorkplaneRulerPicks.jsx`: calls the default `THREE.Mesh.prototype.raycast` then forces every hit's `distance = -1e-4` so the mesh sorts to the FRONT of the intersect queue regardless of stacked geometry.
- Applied to: (a) every snap-dot mesh in `SnapDots`, (b) the origin sphere + inner ring in `WorkplaneRuler.jsx`.
- Snap-dot radius bumped 1.8 → 2.6 mm for a more forgiving click target.
- Origin ↻/× action buttons enlarged 5×5 → 6×6, translate offset increased to +24/-24 px, and lifted to `zIndexRange={[9999, 9990]}` so no other `<Html>` overlay (e.g., selection dim chips) can occlude them.
- Explicit `onPointerDown` stops on snap dots for good measure.

### Verified
`testing_agent_v3_fork` iter-115.json — 4/4 in-scope checks PASS. `document.elementFromPoint` at the ↻ button centre correctly returns the button itself even after repeated picks across a stacked cube+cone assembly. Store transitions `{active,placing,origin}` verified through the full flow: place → pick → switch selection → pick → click ↻ → placing banner reappears → click × → removed.

### Files touched
- `frontend/src/components/viewport/WorkplaneRulerPicks.jsx` — added exported `priorityRaycast`, applied to snap-dot meshes, radius bump, onPointerDown stop.
- `frontend/src/components/viewport/WorkplaneRuler.jsx` — imported `priorityRaycast`, applied to origin sphere + inner ring, enlarged/reskinned action buttons, bumped zIndexRange.

## Iteration 116 (2026-07-03) — TinkerCAD ruler-as-reference-origin rework
- ✅ **Retired the two-point PICK measurement system** (rulerPicks store slice, WorkplaneRulerPicks.jsx, PICK hint banner, Clear-measurements button all deleted) — this was the root of the recurring "ruler unresponsive on stacked components" P0 bug.
- ✅ **New RulerPlacementDots.jsx** — during ruler placement, amber dots highlight every visible object's 8 bbox corners (+ workplane origin, de-duped); clicking a dot drops the ruler exactly there. Bed/face click fallback preserved.
- ✅ **Ruler = reference origin** — with ruler placed, selecting ANY object shows size chips (W/D/H) + X/Y/Z position chips measured from the ruler origin, even with the DIMS toggle off. Dashed leader ties origin to the pinned corner.
- ✅ **Editable position chips** — typing a distance MOVES the object so its pinned corner lands at that distance (verified exact: origin [-10,-10,0], typed 25.5 → pos.x 25.5). Undo works.
- ✅ **Focus fix for all chip editors** (DimChip + PositionChip) — drei <Html> re-appends its container after mount, silently dropping same-tick focus (keystrokes went to <body>). Double-focus (immediate + 80ms retry) fixes it.
- ✅ No-ruler default: DIMS toggle shows size + position-from-workplane-origin chips (user choice 3b).
- 🧪 Tested: /app/test_reports/iteration_116.json — 16/16 PASS incl. stacked cube+cone flows, ruler ↻/×/drag, MEASURE regression, undo, no console errors.

## Iteration 117 (2026-07-03) — Ruler elevation readout + scale-aware chip edits
- ✅ **Z position chip = elevation off ruler plane** — pinned corner candidates restricted to the 4 BOTTOM bbox corners, so Z always reads "ruler plane → bottom of part" (user request: elevated bar showed top-corner/centerline height instead). Blue dashed vertical drop-line renders from the pinned corner down to the ruler plane when elevated.
- ✅ **Fixed W/D/H chip math error on scaled objects** — commitAxisLength was writing typed mm straight into parametric dims, ignoring obj.scale (user's 6×-scaled bar: chip showed 120 → typed 100 → became 600mm). Now ratio-based (dims ×= target/currentBBox), correct under scale and rotation, for cube/sphere/cylinder/cone/imported.
- 🧪 Verified via scripted browser test: scaled bar 120→100 edit yields exactly 100mm real size; elevated bar Z chip reads 32.50 = Bottom Z.

## Iteration 118 (2026-07-03) — Group-pull on member resize
- ✅ **Resizing a grouped member pulls attached parts along** — user request: shortening the centre linking bar of a grouped assembly must drag the end cylinders (positive + negative bores) inward with the faces. `applyGroupPull` in store.js: after `updateDims`/`setImportedDim` on an object with a `groupId`, sibling members are translated by the displacement of whichever face they sit beyond (per axis; members straddling the centre follow the centre). Respects bed-pinned Z resizes (min face static → parts above follow the top face). Single undo step reverts everything.
- 🧪 Verified: grouped bar 80→60 moved end cylinders ±55→±45 and bores identically; undo restores all.

## Iteration 119 (2026-07-03) — Gizmo scale group-pull + test dev hook
- ✅ **Scale-gizmo drag on a grouped member now pulls siblings** — same semantics as typed dim edits: dragging a scale handle on the centre bar translates attached parts with the moving faces (they are no longer ratio-scaled). Snapshot of primary bbox + sibling centres at drag start; absolute face displacement applied live during drag (no incremental drift). Non-grouped multi-selections keep the old ratio-scale behaviour.
- ✅ Added `window.__forgeThree` dev hook (ThreeDevHook in Viewport) exposing R3F scene/camera/raycaster for deterministic automated 3D UI testing.
- 🧪 Verified with a REAL pointer drag on the X scale handle (located via in-page raycasting): bar 80→104mm moved cylinders ±55→±67 exactly (expected 67.00), sibling scales unchanged.

## Iteration 120 (2026-07-03) — Touch long-press context menu (iPad grouping)
- ✅ **Long-press (550ms) on the viewport opens the context menu on touch devices** — raycast picks the part under the finger; menu offset +10/-10px from touch point. Implemented via pointer events on the viewport container (touch pointerType only); cancelled by >12px movement, lift-off, or a second finger (pinch).
- ✅ **Long-press selects ADDITIVELY** — no modifier keys on iPad, so each long-press on an unselected part adds it to the selection before opening the menu. iPad grouping flow: long-press part A → Esc/dismiss → long-press part B → "Group selected".
- ✅ ContextMenu outside-close now also listens for touchstart, with a 350ms grace period so the opening long-press can't immediately dismiss it. Container has -webkit-touch-callout/user-select none.
- 🧪 Verified via synthetic touch pointer events: LP1 opened menu + selected cube A, LP2 added cube B (menu header "2 SELECTED"), "Group selected" created shared groupId, outliner shows ASSEMBLY group.

## Iteration 121 (2026-07-03) — Touch-friendly targets + more translucent chips
- ✅ Dimension + position chips: background 0.80 → 0.55 alpha with 3px backdrop blur (editors 0.78) — geometry visible through chips, digits still readable.
- ✅ Finger-friendly targets on coarse-pointer devices (iPad): chips px-3/py-2 + 13px text + wider inputs (IS_COARSE via matchMedia in SelectionDimLabels.jsx); ruler ↻/× buttons w-6→w-10 (WorkplaneRuler.jsx); top-toolbar buttons min-height 40px via @media (pointer: coarse) in index.css.
- 🧪 Verified: chips render translucent, W chip edit still commits correctly (20→30mm).

## Iteration 122 (2026-07-03) — Backend code-review fixes
- ✅ Circular import admin.py↔server.py removed properly: `build_admin_router(*, db, get_current_user)` now takes the session resolver via dependency injection (lazy `from server import` deleted; unused `public_user` param dropped).
- ✅ admin.py split into `_make_guards`/`_make_audit` + 4 route groups (identity, user-admin, moderation, insights); shared `_require_user` 404 helper.
- ✅ auth_local.py `build_auth_router` (was complexity 36 / 262 lines) split: brute-force helpers module-level, shared `_check_token_record` (single-use/expiry validation for magic + reset tokens), `_token_row` builder, password vs magic-link route groups. Behavior byte-identical, all messages preserved.
- ✅ billing.py: extracted `_new_transaction_row` + `_grant_tier_if_paid` (idempotent grant) from get_router.
- ✅ email_service.py: extracted `_send` wrapper + `_contributor_celebration_html/_text` + `_digest_html/_text/_digest_row_table` template builders.
- ✅ Test secrets removed: sso-bridge secret now env/backend/.env only (module skips if absent); e2e auth password randomized per run; exports-handoff session token from TEST_SESSION_TOKEN env or freshly seeded in Mongo at test time.
- ℹ️ FALSE POSITIVES rejected: `asyncio.create_subprocess_exec` in orca_engine.py is the safe non-shell subprocess API (not `exec()`); flagged `is` comparisons are all correct `is None` checks.
- 🧪 Verified: 12+17+15 pytest pass (auth e2e, sso bridge, exports handoff, voice templates); admin DI (401 anon / 200 admin), login 401, billing packages OK after backend restart.

## Iteration 123 (2026-07-03) — Admin-editable pricing + early-adopter tiers
- ✅ Pricing moved from hardcoded PACKAGES to DB-backed catalog (`pricing.py`, `billing_config` collection; code defaults as fallback). New defaults: Maker $36/yr, Pro $108/yr, first 100 buyers of each pay $28/$90.
- ✅ Early-adopter engine: sold counts derived from `payment_transactions` (tier_granted=True, all providers); effective price resolved server-side at charge time in BOTH checkout paths (Braintree primary + Stripe fallback).
- ✅ /admin Pricing tab (SUPER-ADMIN only, hidden for regular admins): edit yearly price, early price, early spots per tier; shows sold + remaining; saves live instantly (no redeploy). GET/PUT /api/admin/pricing with validation (early ≤ base) + audit rows.
- ✅ PricingPage: effective price + strikethrough regular price + "Early adopter — N of 100 spots left" badge; BraintreeDialog shows effective amount.
- ✅ ROADMAP: added BYO Meshy AI key ToDo (user-provided key = uncapped; multi-provider = explore later).
- 🧪 Verified: packages endpoint returns 28/90 effective; PUT roundtrip changes live price and restores; early>base rejected 400; anon PUT 401; UI screenshots of pricing page badges + admin editor + save toast.
